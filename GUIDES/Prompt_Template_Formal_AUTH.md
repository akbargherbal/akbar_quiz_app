Okay, let's pick up where we left off on the **Django Quiz App's Modular Authentication** component.

We're continuing to follow our **Authentication Iteration Guide**.

Last session, we successfully finished **Phase [Phase #], Step [Step #.#]** ([Briefly describe what was achieved, e.g., 'enabled the core auth backend and passed regression tests']).

The next step on our map is **Phase [Next Phase #], Step [Next Step #.#]**, where the goal is to [Briefly describe the purpose of the new step, e.g., 'optionally link Quiz Attempts to users'].

So, the specific task for **this session** is: [Mention the core task, e.g., 'Modify the QuizAttempt model in models.py to add the nullable 'user' ForeignKey'].

And we'll **verify** this step is complete when: [Describe the specific verification method from the guide, e.g., '`makemigrations` and `migrate` run successfully without errors'].
