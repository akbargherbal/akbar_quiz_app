Story:

Here's what happens on the page once the quiz loads and the script starts working:

1.  **Quiz Setup:** The page first tries to load the quiz questions provided by your Django view. If questions are loaded successfully, the timer starts[cite: 127], and the user interface prepares for the quiz. If no questions are loaded (e.g., an error or no quiz found), it might show an error or default demo questions.
2.  **First Question Display:** You see the first question text along with its multiple-choice answer buttons below it. At the top, there's a progress bar showing you're at the beginning[cite: 237], a star rating area (initially likely full stars or based on initial state)[cite: 107, 238], a counter showing "1 / total number of questions", and a "Home" button.
3.  **Selecting an Answer:** You click on one of the answer buttons[cite: 133, 244].
    * Immediately after you click, all buttons become disabled, preventing you from clicking again.
    * The page checks if your selected answer is correct.
4.  **Feedback Display:**
    * **If Correct:** The button you clicked turns green and gets a glowing, pulsing effect. All the *other* answer buttons instantly disappear[cite: 174].
    * **If Incorrect:** The button you clicked turns red. The correct answer button turns green and gets the glowing, pulsing effect. All other incorrect answer buttons (that weren't your choice or the correct one) instantly disappear[cite: 174].
5.  **Moving to the Next Question:** After a short delay (a few seconds, potentially longer if you were incorrect), the feedback effects stop, the remaining buttons disappear, and the next question appears along with its answer buttons. The progress bar updates[cite: 237], and the question counter increments (e.g., "2 / total"). The star rating might also update based on your performance[cite: 107, 238].
6.  **Quiz Completion:** When you answer the last question, instead of showing a new question, a "Quiz Results" panel appears.
7.  **Results Display:** This panel shows:
    * Your final star rating[cite: 248].
    * Your score (e.g., "8 / 10").
    * Your score as a percentage.
    * The total time you took to complete the quiz.
    * A "Mistakes Review" section listing the questions you got wrong, showing the question text and the correct answer. If you made no mistakes, it shows a success message[cite: 253].
8.  **Final Actions:** Below the results, you see two buttons: "Go Home" (takes you back to the main page) and "Play Again" (restarts the same quiz from the beginning)[cite: 157, 263].
