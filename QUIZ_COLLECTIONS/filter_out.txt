Okay, based on the Java questions that were filtered out, here are the keywords and patterns that serve as strong indicators for detecting them (and similar questions from other non-target stacks):

1.  **Explicit Language Name:**
    *   **`Java`**: The most obvious keyword. Questions mentioning "Java application," "Java project," or language features explicitly tied to Java ("Singleton pattern in Java") are clear indicators.

2.  **Specific Framework/Library Names (from that language's ecosystem):**
    *   **`Log4j` / `Log4j 2`**: These are well-known logging frameworks specifically for Java. Their presence is a very strong signal.
    *   **`SLF4J` (Simple Logging Facade for Java)**: Another Java-specific logging component.

3.  **Configuration File Names/Formats (Characteristic of that ecosystem):**
    *   **`log4j2.xml`**: This specific filename points directly to Log4j 2 configuration, typically used in Java projects. While Python uses config files, `.xml` for this purpose is much less common than `.py`, `.ini`, or `.env`.
    *   **`<Appender>` / `additivity="false"`**: These are specific configuration elements/attributes within Log4j's XML structure. Seeing XML tags related to configuration is a hint towards Java/.NET ecosystems.

4.  **Specific Method Names / Idioms (Common in that language):**
    *   **`logger.isDebugEnabled()`**: While Python has ways to check log levels (`logger.isEnabledFor(logging.DEBUG)`), the exact method name `isDebugEnabled()` is highly characteristic of Log4j/SLF4J.
    *   **Parameterized Logging syntax (`logger.info("Event ID: {}, User: {}", ...)`):** While Python's `logging` uses `%` formatting or f-strings, this `{}` placeholder style without an `f` prefix is the standard for SLF4J/Log4j 2 parameterized messages.

5.  **Specific Concepts (when tied to the language):**
    *   **Singleton Pattern in Java**: While a general pattern, explicitly linking it to "Java" helps confirm the context.
    *   **Exception Stack Trace (in Java context)**: Mentioning debugging practices like logging stack traces specifically within a "Java applications" context reinforces the language focus.

In summary, you're looking for:
*   The name of a language *other than* Python or JavaScript.
*   Names of libraries or frameworks *known* to belong to other language ecosystems.
*   Configuration file types or specific configuration syntax/keywords characteristic of other ecosystems.
*   Function/method names or programming idioms that are distinct to other languages.



Based on the previous analysis of the provided files:

*   **QM_0.txt:** All questions were related to the Python/Django or JS/HTML/CSS stack.
*   **QM_1.txt:** A set of questions related to Java were identified.
*   **QM_2.txt:** All questions were related to the Python/Django or JS/HTML/CSS stack.
*   **QM_3.txt & QM_4.txt:** All questions were related to the Python/Django or JS/HTML/CSS stack.

The questions filtered out as **not** being related to the Python/Django or JavaScript/HTML/CSS stack were the following (all from `QM_1.txt`):

1.  `In a Java application using Log4j 2, what is the common way to obtain a Logger instance for a specific class, such as com.example.MyClass?`
2.  `Which of the following Log4j log levels is typically used to output fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application, and is generally of a higher verbosity than INFO but less verbose than TRACE?`
3.  `In a Log4j 2 configuration file (e.g., log4j2.xml), what is the primary role of an <Appender> element?`
4.  `Consider the following Log4j logging statement: if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) { logger.debug("User details: " + user.getComplexDetails()); }. What is a primary benefit of using logger.isDebugEnabled() here, assuming user.getComplexDetails() involves significant computation or object creation?`
5.  `What is a key characteristic and purpose of SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) in a Java project?`
6.  `In the context of debugging Java applications, why is it generally good practice to log an exception's stack trace when an unexpected error is caught and handled?`
7.  `When implementing a Singleton pattern in Java that might be accessed by multiple threads, what is a common technique to ensure thread-safe lazy initialization of the single instance?`
8.  `What is a key advantage of using parameterized logging, such as logger.info("Event ID: {}, User: {}", eventId, userName);, over string concatenation like logger.info("Event ID: " + eventId + ", User: " + userName); when using SLF4J or Log4j 2?`
9.  `In Log4j 2 configuration, what is the effect of setting additivity="false" on a specific logger definition (e.g., <Logger name="com.example.service" level="debug" additivity="false">)?`
