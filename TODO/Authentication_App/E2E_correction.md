**Summary of E2E Test Failures for Correction**

During recent development work involving backend setup (related to user authentication components), the existing End-to-End (E2E) test suites for the `multi_choice_quiz` and `pages` apps started failing. Investigation suggests these failures stem from issues within the test scripts themselves, likely due to incorrect selectors or assertions that don't match the current state of the application's templates, rather than regressions in the application code itself.

**1. Failure in `multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_quiz_e2e.py::test_quiz_loads_and_functions`:**

*   **Symptom:** The test timed out (`TimeoutError: Page.wait_for_selector...`) while waiting for the main quiz container element to become visible on the `/quiz/` page. The specific error was: `waiting for locator(".quiz-container") to be visible`.
*   **Identified Cause:** The test attempts to find an element using the CSS class selector `.quiz-container`. However, the actual HTML in `multi_choice_quiz/templates/multi_choice_quiz/index.html` uses the ID `quiz-app-container` for this main element. The selector in the test is incorrect.
*   **Suggested Fix:** Modify the test to use the correct ID selector: `page.wait_for_selector("#quiz-app-container", state="visible", ...)`.

**2. Failure in `pages/tests/test_templates.py::test_quizzes_page_template`:**

*   **Symptom:** The test failed an assertion (`AssertionError: Locator expected to be visible...`) while checking the visibility of the "All" topic filter button on the `/quizzes/` page. The failing locator was `a.bg-tag-bg:has-text('All')`.
*   **Identified Cause:** The test asserts that the "All" filter button must have the specific class `bg-tag-bg`. This is only true when a *different* filter is selected. By default, when "All" is the active filter, it has a different appearance (likely using the `bg-accent-primary` class according to the template `pages/templates/pages/quizzes.html`). The test's assertion is too specific and doesn't account for the default state.
*   **Suggested Fix:** Make the assertion more robust. Either check for the visibility of the link containing "All" without relying on the specific background class (e.g., `expect(page.locator("a:has-text('All')")).to_be_visible()`) or verify it has the class expected when it's the *active* filter (e.g., `bg-accent-primary`). A simpler check for existence and visibility is recommended.

**Goal:**

Correct these E2E tests (`test_quiz_e2e.py` and `test_templates.py`) so they accurately reflect the application's current HTML structure and state, ensuring the test suite passes reliably.
