Okay, sounds like a good plan. Here is a summary of our progress that you can use for the next session when we start Phase 5.

**Session Summary: Authentication App Implementation (End of Phase 4)**

**Context:** We are following the `Authentication_App_Iteration_Guide.md` (v2 - With Phase Verification Scripts) to implement modular user authentication in the Django Quiz App.

**Progress:**
*   **Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been successfully completed and verified.**
*   **Phase 1:** Core Django auth backend enabled, migrations applied, basic login/logout templates created and styled.
*   **Phase 2:** User registration (signup) implemented using `UserCreationForm`, including view, form, template, and automatic login.
*   **Phase 3:** `QuizAttempt` model updated with an optional foreign key to the User model. Submission view logic updated to link attempts for logged-in users while maintaining anonymous functionality.
*   **Phase 4:**
    *   User profile page (`/profile/`) created, accessible only via login (`@login_required`).
    *   Navigation in `pages/base.html` dynamically shows "Profile (username)" & "Logout" (form button) for authenticated users, and "Login" & "Sign Up" links for anonymous users. Login link correctly points to `/accounts/login/` (`{% url 'login' %}`).
    *   Profile page successfully fetches and displays the logged-in user's `QuizAttempt` history.
    *   All associated backend unit tests (`pages/tests/test_views.py`) and E2E tests (`pages/tests/test_templates.py`, including mobile viewport adjustments) are passing.
    *   Phase-specific verification scripts (`test_phase[1-4]_verification.py`) are now correctly located in `src/core/tests/` and all pass.

**Current State:**
*   The codebase is stable and reflects the completion of all steps up to the end of Phase 4.
*   Anonymous users can still browse and take quizzes without interruption.
*   Users can sign up, log in, view their profile with quiz history, and log out.
*   The `staticfiles` warning during testing is noted and accepted as harmless for test environments.

**Next Step:**
*   Begin **Phase 5: Password Management**, starting with Step 5.1 (Implement Password Change Templates).
