Perfect! All 6 tests in `test_phase2_verification.py` passed.

**Phase 2 Verification:**

*   `[X]` **QuizAttempt Model Exists:** Verified model creation and basic querying.
*   `[X]` **QuizAttempt User Field Config:** Verified ForeignKey relationship, nullability, blankability, `on_delete` behavior, and `related_name`.
*   `[X]` **QuizAttempt Instance Creation:** Verified instances can be created with and without a user.
*   `[X]` **Submit Attempt URL Resolves:** Verified the URL `/quiz/submit_attempt/` correctly maps to the intended view.
*   `[X]` **Submission Logic Tested:** Acknowledged successful completion of detailed view tests in Step 2.3.
*   `[X]` **Anonymous E2E Verified:** Acknowledged successful verification of the anonymous E2E flow and database state in Step 2.4.

This confirms that the structural changes and core logic introduced in Phase 2 are correctly implemented and verified.

**Phase 2 is officially complete.**

**Session Summary: Authentication Implementation - Phase 2 Completion**

**Overall Goal:** Iteratively implement modular user authentication for the Django Quiz App.

**Phase Completed in this Session:** Phase 2: Optional Linking of Quiz Attempts to Users

**Objective:** Modify the quiz result submission process to associate attempts with logged-in users *if available*, while maintaining full functionality for anonymous users.

**Steps Completed & Verification:**

*   **Step 2.1: Modify Models & Generate Migrations**
    *   **Task:** Added `QuizAttempt` model with an optional `user` ForeignKey (null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL) to `multi_choice_quiz/models.py`.
    *   **Verification:** `makemigrations` and `migrate` commands ran successfully. `TestPhase2Verification.test_quiz_attempt_model_exists`, `test_quiz_attempt_user_field_configuration`, and `test_quiz_attempt_model_creation` PASSED.
*   **Step 2.2: Update Submission View Logic**
    *   **Task:** Created `submit_quiz_attempt` view in `multi_choice_quiz/views.py` to handle POST requests with quiz results, determine if `request.user` is authenticated, and save `QuizAttempt` accordingly. Added corresponding URL in `multi_choice_quiz/urls.py`. Modified `quiz_detail` view and template to pass `quiz_id`. Updated `app.js` to fetch/POST results on completion.
    *   **Verification:** `manage.py check` passed. `TestPhase2Verification.test_submit_attempt_url_resolves` PASSED.
*   **Step 2.3: Write/Update Submission Tests**
    *   **Task:** Added tests in `multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_views.py` using `client.post` and `client.force_login` to verify `submit_quiz_attempt` view handles anonymous (QuizAttempt.user=None) and authenticated (QuizAttempt.user=logged_in_user) submissions, plus error cases. Fixed a failing test in `test_quiz_detail_view_loads`.
    *   **Verification:** `python manage.py test multi_choice_quiz.tests.test_views` result: OK (9 tests passed). `TestPhase2Verification.test_submission_logic_verified_by_app_tests` PASSED (acknowledging).
*   **Step 2.4: Verify Anonymous E2E Flow & DB State**
    *   **Task:** Ran existing anonymous E2E test (`run_multi_choice_quiz_e2e_tests.py`). Registered `QuizAttempt` in admin and manually verified the resulting database record had `user=None`.
    *   **Verification:** E2E test passed. Admin screenshot confirmed anonymous attempt was recorded correctly. `TestPhase2Verification.test_anonymous_e2e_flow_verified` PASSED (acknowledging).

**Current Status:**

*   Phase 2 is functionally complete and verified by backend tests, E2E tests, and manual inspection.
*   The application now correctly saves quiz attempts, optionally linking them to authenticated users while preserving the anonymous user experience.

**Next Step for Next Session:** Begin **Phase 3: Basic User-Facing Profile & Navigation**, starting by completing **Step 3.1: Create Profile View & URL (Login Required)** by writing the necessary verification tests in `pages/tests/test_views.py`.
