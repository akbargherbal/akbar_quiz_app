Please implement a feature in the provided Django codebase to visually distinguish quizzes that an authenticated user has already attempted.

The goal is to:
1.  Modify the appearance of quiz cards on the **Home page (featured quizzes)** and the **Quizzes page (full list)**.
2.  If a quiz has been attempted by the logged-in user:
    a.  Change the border color of the quiz card.
    b.  Change the "Start Quiz" button's background color and text to "Retake Quiz".
3.  This visual distinction should only apply to authenticated users. Anonymous users should see the default styling.

**Instructions & File Locations:**

**1. Backend Modification (pages/views.py):**

*   In the `home` view within `src/pages/views.py`:
    *   After the `featured_quizzes_list` is finalized, and *if the user is authenticated*, iterate through this list.
    *   For each `quiz_obj` in `featured_quizzes_list`, set a new attribute `quiz_obj.has_attempted = True` if `quiz_obj.id` is in the `attempted_quiz_ids` list (which is already fetched in the view). Otherwise, set it to `False`.

**2. Frontend Template Modifications:**

*   **File: `src/pages/home.html` (Featured Quizzes Section)**
    *   Locate the loop: `{% for quiz in featured_quizzes %}`.
    *   Find the main `div` for the quiz card (currently has classes like `bg-surface rounded-xl ...`).
    *   **Conditionally change its border:**
        *   If `quiz.has_attempted` is true, add `border-purple-500 hover:border-purple-400`.
        *   Else (not attempted or user not authenticated), keep the existing `border-border hover:border-accent-primary`.
    *   Find the "Start Quiz" `<a>` tag.
    *   **Conditionally change its background color:**
        *   If `quiz.has_attempted` is true, change its background classes to `bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700`.
        *   Else, keep `bg-accent-primary hover:bg-accent-hover`.
    *   **Conditionally change its text:**
        *   If `quiz.has_attempted` is true, change the text to "Retake Quiz".
        *   Else, keep "Start Quiz".

*   **File: `src/pages/quizzes.html` (Quizzes Grid Section)**
    *   Locate the loop: `{% for quiz in quizzes %}`.
    *   Find the main `div` for the quiz card (similar structure to `home.html`).
    *   **Conditionally change its border** (same logic as `home.html`):
        *   If `quiz.has_attempted` is true, add `border-purple-500 hover:border-purple-400`.
        *   Else, keep `border-border hover:border-accent-primary`.
        *   *(The `quizzes` view already provides the `has_attempted` attribute on `quiz` objects for authenticated users, so no extra backend logic is needed for this page.)*
    *   Find the "Start Quiz" `<a>` tag.
    *   **Conditionally change its background color** (same logic as `home.html`):
        *   If `quiz.has_attempted` is true, change its background classes to `bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700`.
        *   Else, keep `bg-accent-primary hover:bg-accent-hover`.
    *   **Conditionally change its text** (same logic as `home.html`):
        *   If `quiz.has_attempted` is true, change the text to "Retake Quiz".
        *   Else, keep "Start Quiz".

**Styling Notes:**
*   The Tailwind CSS classes `border-purple-500`, `hover:border-purple-400`, `bg-indigo-600`, and `hover:bg-indigo-700` should be used for the "attempted" state.
*   Ensure the existing hover effects for non-attempted quizzes remain functional.

**Context from Codebase:**
*   The `pages/views.py` `quizzes` view already annotates quiz objects with `has_attempted` for authenticated users.
*   Quiz attempt data is stored in the `QuizAttempt` model in `multi_choice_quiz/models.py`.
*   Relevant Tailwind color definitions can be found in `pages/templates/pages/base.html` if needed for reference (e.g., `accent-primary`, `border-border`).
