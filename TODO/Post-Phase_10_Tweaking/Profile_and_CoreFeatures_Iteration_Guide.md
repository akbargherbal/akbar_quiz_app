**Project:** QuizMaster
**Date Updated:** 2025-05-12
**Corresponding Requirements Doc:** `Project_Requirements.md` v2.6

## Overview

This guide outlines the development steps for enhancing the user profile and implementing core features like mistake tracking, review, and collection management, corresponding to Phases 5 through 13 of the project requirements.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 5: Foundational Attempt Tracking & Profile Page Structure (Revised) - COMPLETE

*   **Objective:** Store overall quiz attempt results and establish the final, responsive profile page structure based on Mockup 1 (Stats Above Tabs), including the initial display of quiz history.
*   **Status:** Completed in Session 4. Verification script: `src/pages/tests/user_profile/test_phase5_verification.py`. Branch `feature/phase5-profile-foundation` merged to main.
*   **Key Outcomes:**
    *   `QuizAttempt` model includes `attempt_details` JSONField.
    *   `submit_quiz_attempt` endpoint saves basic attempt data.
    *   Frontend sends basic results.
    *   `profile_view` requires login and fetches attempt history.
    *   `profile.html` structure matches Mockup 1 (Stats above Tabs for History/Collections). History tab displays attempts.
    *   Profile page is responsive and verified.

### Phase 6: Detailed Mistake Data Capture - COMPLETE

*   **Objective:** Capture _exactly_ which questions were answered incorrectly during a quiz attempt and store this detailed data.
*   **Status:** Completed in Session 5. Verification script: `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/mistake_tracking/test_phase6_verification.py`. Branch `feature/phase6-mistake-capture` merged to main.
*   **Key Outcomes:**
    *   Frontend (`app.js`) collects detailed answer map (`{questionId: selectedOptionIndex}`).
    *   Frontend sends this map as `attempt_details` in the submission payload.
    *   Backend (`submit_quiz_attempt`) processes received details, compares with correct answers, and stores only the mistakes in the `QuizAttempt.attempt_details` JSONField.
    *   Verification tests confirm correct storage and handling of edge cases (perfect score, missing details).

### Phase 7: Basic Mistake Review Interface (High Priority) - COMPLETE

*   **Objective:** Allow the user to review the specific mistakes made in a past attempt.
*   **Status:** Completed in Session 6. Verification script: `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/mistake_tracking/test_phase7_verification.py`. Branch `feature/phase7-mistake-review` merged to main.
*   **Key Outcomes:**
    *   `attempt_mistake_review` view implemented with ownership checks and data preparation.
    *   `mistake_review.html` template created to display mistakes.
    *   Conditional "Review Mistakes" link added to profile history.
    *   Verification script confirms end-to-end flow.

### Phase 8: Password Management - COMPLETE

*   **Objective:** Implement standard Django password change and reset functionality.
*   **Status:** Completed in Session 7. Verification script: `src/pages/tests/auth/test_phase8_verification.py`. Changes merged to main.
*   **Key Outcomes:**
    *   All necessary password management templates (`password_*.html`, `password_reset_email.html`) verified.
    *   `EMAIL_BACKEND` confirmed for console output.
    *   Password change and reset flows manually E2E tested and confirmed functional.
    *   Verification script for URL resolution and template rendering passed.

### Phase 9: Collection Models, Profile Population & Public Browsing (Revised) - COMPLETE

*   **Objective:** Implement models for `SystemCategory` and `UserCollection`. Populate profile with dynamic stats/collections. Update public quiz browsing. Implement basic profile editing.
*   **Status:** Completed in Session 9. Verification script: `src/pages/tests/user_profile/test_phase9_verification.py`. Branch `feature/phase9-collections-profile` merged to main.
*   **Key Outcomes:**
    *   `SystemCategory` and `UserCollection` models defined and migrated. Admin interfaces implemented.
    *   `profile_view` updated to fetch/calculate dynamic data; `profile.html` populated.
    *   `quizzes` view and template updated for `SystemCategory` filtering.
    *   `home` view and template updated for featured `SystemCategory` instances.
    *   Basic Edit Profile (email) functionality implemented and linked.
    *   HTMX/AJAX evaluation for Collections tab documented (deferred).

### Phase 10: User Collection Management & Import Integration (Revised) - COMPLETE

*   **Objective:** Allow users to create/manage private `UserCollection`s. Implement UI for adding global quizzes to private collections. Implement `SystemCategory` assignment during import.
*   **Status:** Completed in Session 11 (Req 10.c completed in Session 13 as part of refactoring). Verification script: `src/pages/tests/collections_mgmt/test_phase10_verification.py`. Branch `feature/phase10-collection-mgmt` merged.
*   **Key Outcomes:**
    *   `UserCollection` creation implemented (form, view, URL, UI on profile).
    *   Quiz removal from `UserCollection` (from profile) implemented.
    *   Adding quizzes to `UserCollection` from public lists implemented (select collection page, add view).
    *   UX Decisions for collection management (full page reloads) documented.
    *   Req 10.c (SystemCategory in import scripts) completed.

### Performance Refactoring: Bulk Create for Imports - COMPLETE

*   **Objective:** Refactor quiz import logic to use `bulk_create` for `Question` and `Option` objects to improve performance, especially with PostgreSQL.
*   **Status:** Completed in Session 16. Branch `feature/refactor-bulk-import` merged to main.
*   **Key Outcomes:**
    *   `quiz_bank_to_models` in `multi_choice_quiz/utils.py` refactored.
    *   All relevant unit tests for import scripts and utilities passed, confirming functional correctness.
    *   Qualitative performance verification (Step PERF.2) discussed; improvement expected.
