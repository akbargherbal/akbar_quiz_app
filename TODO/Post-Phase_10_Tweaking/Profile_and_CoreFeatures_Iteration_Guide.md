## Overview

This guide outlines the development steps for enhancing the user profile and implementing core features like mistake tracking, review, and collection management, corresponding to Phases 5 through 13 of the project requirements.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 5: Foundational Attempt Tracking & Profile Page Structure (Revised) - COMPLETE

*   **Objective:** Store overall quiz attempt results and establish the final, responsive profile page structure based on Mockup 1 (Stats Above Tabs), including the initial display of quiz history.
*   **Status:** Completed in Session 4. Verification script: `src/pages/tests/user_profile/test_phase5_verification.py`. Branch `feature/phase5-profile-foundation` merged to main.
*   **Key Outcomes:**
    *   `QuizAttempt` model includes `attempt_details` JSONField.
    *   `submit_quiz_attempt` endpoint saves basic attempt data.
    *   Frontend sends basic results.
    *   `profile_view` requires login and fetches attempt history.
    *   `profile.html` structure matches Mockup 1 (Stats above Tabs for History/Collections). History tab displays attempts.
    *   Profile page is responsive and verified.

### Phase 6: Detailed Mistake Data Capture - COMPLETE

*   **Objective:** Capture _exactly_ which questions were answered incorrectly during a quiz attempt and store this detailed data.
*   **Status:** Completed in Session 5. Verification script: `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/mistake_tracking/test_phase6_verification.py`. Branch `feature/phase6-mistake-capture` merged to main.
*   **Key Outcomes:**

    *   Frontend sends this map as `attempt_details` in the submission payload.
    *   Backend (`submit_quiz_attempt`) processes received details, compares with correct answers, and stores only the mistakes in the `QuizAttempt.attempt_details` JSONField.
    *   Verification tests confirm correct storage and handling of edge cases (perfect score, missing details).

### Phase 7: Basic Mistake Review Interface (High Priority) - COMPLETE

*   **Objective:** Allow the user to review the specific mistakes made in a past attempt.
*   **Status:** Completed in Session 6. Verification script: `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/mistake_tracking/test_phase7_verification.py`. Branch `feature/phase7-mistake-review` merged to main.

    *   Quiz removal from `UserCollection` (from profile) implemented.
    *   Adding quizzes to `UserCollection` from public lists implemented (select collection page, add view).
    *   UX Decisions for collection management (full page reloads) documented.
    *   Req 10.c (SystemCategory in import scripts) completed.

### Performance Refactoring: Bulk Create for Imports - COMPLETE

*   **Objective:** Refactor quiz import logic to use `bulk_create` for `Question` and `Option` objects to improve performance, especially with PostgreSQL.
*   **Status:** Completed in Session 16. Branch `feature/refactor-bulk-import` merged to main.
*   **Key Outcomes:**
    *   `quiz_bank_to_models` in `multi_choice_quiz/utils.py` refactored.

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 11.1: Navbar Enhancement - Profile Link Text & Avatar Placeholder

*   **Objective:** Clean up navbar and improve visual identity (Req 11.a; UI/UX Ref #1, #7).
*   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  Modify `pages/templates/pages/base.html`:
        *   Change the "Profile (username)" link text to just display the username (e.g., `({{ user.username }})`) or an alternative concise format.
        *   Add markup for a circular avatar placeholder (e.g., a `div` with user's initial) next to the username link. Apply Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   **Deliverables:** Updated `pages/templates/pages/base.html`.
*   **Verification Checklist:**
    *   `[ ]` **Manual E2E Check:** Verify navbar shows concise username and avatar placeholder for logged-in users on desktop and mobile.
    *   `[ ]` **Playwright (Optional):** Update snapshot tests or add specific locators if existing E2E tests for navigation are affected.
*   **Status:** To Do ‚è≥

#### Step 11.2: Fix Quiz Collection Redirection

*   **Objective:** Improve user flow when adding quizzes to collections by redirecting to the previous page (Req 11.b; UI/UX Ref #3).
*   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  Modify `pages/views.py::add_quiz_to_selected_collection_view`:
        *   Update the view to accept a `next` URL parameter.
        *   If `next` is provided and safe, redirect to it. Otherwise, fall back to `pages:profile`.
    2.  Modify `pages/templates/pages/select_collection_for_quiz.html`:
        *   Ensure the "Add to this Collection" forms pass the current page's path (or a desired `next` path) as a hidden input or query parameter to `add_quiz_to_selected_collection_view`.
    3.  Modify `pages/templates/pages/quizzes.html` and `pages/templates/pages/home.html`:
        *   When generating the link to `select_collection_for_quiz_view`, include the current page's path as a `next` query parameter (e.g., `?next={{ request.get_full_path|urlencode }}`).
*   **Deliverables:** Updated `pages/views.py`, `select_collection_for_quiz.html`, `quizzes.html`, `home.html`.
*   **Verification Checklist:**
    *   `[ ]` **Unit Tests:** For `add_quiz_to_selected_collection_view` to check `next` parameter handling.
    *   `[ ]` **Manual E2E Check:**
        *   Add quiz from `/quizzes/` -> verify redirect back to `/quizzes/` (with filters if any).
        *   Add quiz from `/` (homepage) -> verify redirect back to `/`.
        *   If `next` is invalid/missing, verify redirect to profile.
*   **Status:** To Do ‚è≥

#### Step 11.3: Reorder Attempted Quizzes & Refine Featured Quizzes

*   **Objective:** Improve content discovery by reordering attempted quizzes and refining featured quiz logic (Req 11.c; UI/UX Ref #4, #8).
*   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  Modify `pages/views.py::quizzes` view:
        *   If user is authenticated, fetch IDs of quizzes they've attempted.
        *   Annotate the main quiz queryset with a boolean indicating if it's been attempted.
        *   Adjust `order_by` to sort by `attempted` (False first), then by existing criteria (e.g., `-created_at`).
    2.  Modify `pages/views.py::home` view (for featured quizzes):
        *   If user is authenticated, fetch IDs of quizzes they've attempted.
        *   Exclude attempted quizzes from the initial pool for featured quizzes, or heavily down-rank them. Ensure enough non-attempted quizzes are available to feature.
*   **Deliverables:** Updated `pages/views.py`.
*   **Verification Checklist:**
    *   `[ ]` **Unit Tests:** For view logic changes verifying correct ordering and exclusion.
    *   `[ ]` **Manual E2E Check:**
        *   As a logged-in user, take a quiz. Verify it moves to the end of the list on `/quizzes/`.
        *   Verify featured quizzes on homepage prioritize unattempted ones.
*   **Status:** To Do ‚è≥

#### Step 11.4: Make Profile Collections Collapsible/Expandable

*   **Objective:** Improve organization on the profile page for users with many collections (Req 11.d; UI/UX Ref #4).
*   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  Modify `pages/templates/pages/profile.html`:
        *   For each collection in the "Collections" tab, add Alpine.js `x-data="{ open: false }"`.
        *   Add a button/clickable header to toggle `open`.
        *   Wrap the list of quizzes within that collection in an element with `x-show="open"`.
        *   Style the toggle and collapsed/expanded states.
*   **Deliverables:** Updated `pages/templates/pages/profile.html`.
*   **Verification Checklist:**
    *   `[ ]` **Manual E2E Check:** Verify collections are collapsible/expandable. Test with multiple collections and quizzes.
    *   `[ ]` **Playwright (Optional):** Add tests to `test_profile_responsive_layout` in `pages/tests/test_responsive.py` to check collapse/expand functionality.
*   **Status:** To Do ‚è≥

#### Step 11.5: Profile Page Polish (Stat Placeholders & Attempt Counts)

*   **Objective:** Enhance profile page clarity and information (Req 11.e; UI/UX Ref #8, #2).
*   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  Modify `pages/templates/pages/profile.html`:
        *   Update placeholder text for "Strongest Topic" and "Needs Review" stats (e.g., "Analysis Coming Soon!").
    2.  Modify `pages/views.py::profile_view`:
        *   Annotate `QuizAttempt` records (or perform separate queries) to count attempts per unique quiz for the current user.
        *   Pass this attempt count data to the template context.
    3.  Modify `pages/templates/pages/profile.html`:
        *   In the "Quiz History" tab, display the attempt count next to each quiz title (e.g., "History Quiz 1 (Taken 3 times)").
*   **Deliverables:** Updated `pages/views.py`, `pages/templates/pages/profile.html`.
*   **Verification Checklist:**
    *   `[ ]` **Unit Tests:** For `profile_view` to verify new context data (attempt counts).
    *   `[ ]` **Manual E2E Check:** Verify updated stat placeholders and attempt counts in history.
*   **Status:** To Do ‚è≥

#### Step 11.6: Phase 11 Verification

*   **Objective:** Verify all UI/UX tweaks are implemented correctly and improve usability.
*   **Key Tasks:** Create/update verification scripts or perform targeted E2E/manual checks for each implemented step.
*   **Deliverables:** Potentially updated test scripts (`test_responsive.py`, `test_templates.py`, new phase-specific verification if needed).
*   **Verification Checklist:** `[ ]` All targeted UI/UX improvements confirmed via tests or manual checks.
*   **Status:** To Do ‚è≥
