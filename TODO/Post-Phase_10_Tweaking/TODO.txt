### âœ… To-Do List (with Priorities & Annotations)

1. **Reorder Taken Quizzes**
   Quizzes that have already been taken should appear at the end of the quiz list.
   **Priority:** High

2. **Track Quiz Attempts in Profile**
   In the user's profile, display how many times each quiz has been taken.
   **Priority:** High

3. **Fix Quiz Collection Behavior**
   When a quiz is added to a collection, the user should be redirected back to the page they were on, not to their profile.
   Avoid context-switching for the user.
   **Priority:** High
   **Note:** Properly test this flow; evaluate if HTMX can simplify this interaction.

4. **Improve Featured Quizzes Logic**
   Featured quizzes should prioritize ones the user hasn't attempted.
   **Priority:** Medium
   **Note:** May be redundant if quizzes are already reordered based on whether they've been taken (see item #1).

5. **Enhance Collections Visibility on Home Page**
   Make quiz collections more prominent in the homepage layout/design.
   **Priority:** Low

6. **Visualize Time Spent on Quizzes per Day**
   Explore a simple but effective way to track and visualize how much time users spend each day on the app.
   Consider a date-based heatmap, similar to GitHub's contribution graph.
   **Priority:** Exploratory / Low but Nice to Have if implementation is easy.
   **Goal:** Help users reflect on their learning activity and maintain engagement.
   ** For example there is already a placholder for that - 3. Track Your Progress; Could have it's own logic and view **

7. Navbar:
If the user is logged in remove the word Profile; consider adding placholder for avatar.
Priority: High

8. Consider Search Utility; search quizzes.

9. Deleteing quiz should prompt a modal not an alert prompt.
