This is our 16th session in an ongoing series. To begin, I’d like you to reacquaint yourself with the overall objectives of this project.
Please review the codebase of the Django Quiz App, paying particular attention to the following components:
* The user profile template
* The `src/docs` directory, specifically:
  * `Testing Guide`
  * `LGID Paper V4_Research_Paper.md`
Confirm that you have reviewed the user profile page, read the Testing Guide, and the LGID Paper.
Later in this session, I’ll provide the context you wrote for yourself at the end of the previous session. We'll update that context in each session to reflect what has been accomplished and outline plans for the next session.
--------
In each session, we document our progress and upcoming tasks in a single file called context.md. Please review this file to understand our current status and the objectives for this session.
Additionally, go over the project requirements and the implementation guide we are following for this phase of the work.
