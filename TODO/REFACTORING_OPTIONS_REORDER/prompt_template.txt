You are assisting in analyzing the feasibility and impact of a proposed feature for a JavaScript file (`app.js`) used in the frontend of a web application. This script uses Alpine.js and controls a quiz interface.

**Current Behavior:**
When a user clicks an answer option button:
1.  All answer buttons immediately become unresponsive to further clicks.
2.  Visual feedback is applied:
    * The clicked button changes color â€“ typically green if it was the correct answer, or red if it was incorrect.
    * If an incorrect button was clicked, the actual correct answer button also changes color to green, highlighting it.
3.  Simultaneously, any buttons that were *neither* the one clicked *nor* the actual correct answer instantly disappear from view.
4.  This feedback state (colors shown, other buttons hidden) remains visible for a brief period, the duration of which might depend on whether the initial answer was correct or incorrect.
5.  After this timed delay, the feedback appearance is removed, and the interface prepares to display the next question and its options.

**Proposed Feature:**
Instead of the above mechanism (styling/hiding buttons *in place*), during the feedback phase:
1.  The HTML button element for the **correct** answer should be dynamically moved to appear as the first option visually, directly below the question text.
2.  If an incorrect option was chosen, that specific button should be moved to appear second.
3.  All other option buttons should be hidden or removed.
4.  This reordered state should persist for the feedback duration and then reset correctly for the next question.

**Task:**
Analyze the feasibility, complexity, reversibility, and potential impact of implementing this **Proposed Feature** within the existing `app.js` structure. Consider that the implementation should be relatively simple, easily reversible (easy to comment out or toggle off without breaking the original functionality), and should not require major refactoring of the existing code.

The file to consider is `app.js` located at `static/multi_choice_quiz/app.js` in the provided codebase context.

**IMPORTANT:** Your response will be automatically parsed. Do not include ANY introductory text, explanations, or final comments. Your entire response must focus *only* on evaluating the proposed feature based on the criteria below, using the specified categories and format.

<RESULTS>
FEATURE_FEASIBILITY||Assessment (e.g., "Feasible with moderate complexity", "Technically possible but potentially complex within constraints")||Affected Component (e.g., "app.js - Requires direct DOM manipulation")||confidence:high/medium/low||Reasoning (e.g., "Moving elements is standard JS, but integrating smoothly with Alpine's declarative updates and ensuring clean resets adds complexity")
IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLEXITY||Level (e.g., "Low", "Moderate", "High compared to current method")||Affected Component (e.g., "app.js - Logic within option selection handler")||confidence:high/medium/low||Reasoning (e.g., "Requires identifying elements, changing DOM structure, managing temporary state, resetting - significantly more steps than toggling CSS classes")
REVERSIBILITY_ASSESSMENT||Ease (e.g., "Easy if new logic is isolated", "Moderate, requires careful implementation", "Difficult if logic is intertwined")||Affected Component (e.g., "app.js - Structure of implementation")||confidence:high/medium/low||Reasoning (e.g., "Can be made toggleable with a flag and isolated function calls, but requires discipline during implementation to avoid altering original logic flow directly")
AFFECTED_CODE_LOCATIONS||Function/Area List (e.g., "Option selection handler (like selectOption), styling logic (like getOptionClass), next question transition logic")||Affected Component (e.g., "app.js")||confidence:high/medium/low||Details (e.g., "Selection handler needs new DOM code; styling logic role might change/reduce; reset logic needed before next question loads")
POTENTIAL_SIDE_EFFECTS||Description (e.g., "Risk of interfering with Alpine.js DOM updates", "Potential for visual glitches if reset fails", "Timing issues during feedback")||Affected Component (e.g., "app.js - Interaction between imperative DOM changes and Alpine state")||confidence:high/medium/low||Details (e.g., "Manual DOM changes might conflict if Alpine tries to update the same elements based on state changes simultaneously; incomplete reset could leave wrong buttons visible")
</RESULTS>

Each finding must be on its own line with fields separated by double pipes (||). Provide your evaluation in the first field as specified for each category. For **Affected Component**, specify the main area. Use the **Reasoning/Details** field to justify your assessment, mentioning relevant logic areas (like option selection, styling, state reset). Provide a confidence level (high, medium, low) for each assessment based on typical JavaScript/Alpine.js patterns.
