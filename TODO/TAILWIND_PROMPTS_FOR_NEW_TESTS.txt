**Prompt 1: For `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_quiz_e2e.py`**

```text
**Role:** You are an expert Python developer assisting with updating Playwright E2E tests for a Django application.

**Context:**
The `multi_choice_quiz` app in my Django project was just refactored. The original vanilla CSS style.css styling for the quiz interface has been largely replaced with Tailwind CSS utility classes, though some custom CSS classes remain in use.. The goal was to maintain the existing visual appearance and user flow, but the underlying HTML `class` attributes have changed significantly.

As a result, the Playwright test file `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_quiz_e2e.py` needs to be updated because its selectors, which relied on the old CSS class names (like `.quiz-container`, `.question-text`, `.option-button`, `.option-button.correct-answer`, `.option-button.incorrect-answer`), are now broken.

**Objective:**
Rewrite the provided Playwright test code in `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_quiz_e2e.py` to work with the new Tailwind CSS structure found in the updated `multi_choice_quiz` app codebase (especially the `index.html` template). The core test logic, steps, and assertions should remain the same; only the **element selectors** used by Playwright need to be updated.

**Input:**

1.  **Original Test Code (`src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_quiz_e2e.py`):**
    ```python
    # [Paste the original content of src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_quiz_e2e.py here]
    ```

2.  **Updated `multi_choice_quiz` App Codebase (with Tailwind):**
    ```python
    # [Provide the relevant updated code, especially multi_choice_quiz/templates/multi_choice_quiz/index.html]
    # [You can provide the full app directory content if easier, but index.html is key]
    ```

**Instructions:**

1.  **Identify Broken Selectors:** Analyze the original test code and identify all Playwright locators that relied on CSS classes from the old `style.css`.
2.  **Update Selectors:** Examine the *Updated App Codebase* (primarily `index.html`) and replace the old selectors with new ones that correctly target the same logical elements using the new Tailwind structure.
    *   **Priority:** Use `id` or `data-testid` attributes if available in the new HTML (e.g., `page.locator("[data-testid='quiz-option']")`).
    *   **Alternative:** Use combinations of Tailwind classes or structural selectors if stable IDs are not present. Be mindful that relying solely on utility classes can be brittle.
    *   **Feedback Classes:** Pay special attention to selectors for feedback states (e.g., correct/incorrect answers). The classes `.correct-answer`, `.incorrect-answer` will likely be gone. Find the new Tailwind classes or attributes signifying these states.
3.  **Maintain Test Logic:** Do **not** change the sequence of actions or the core logic of the assertions.
4.  **Verify Waits:** Ensure `page.wait_for_...` calls use appropriate selectors/conditions for the new structure.

**Output:**
Provide the complete, updated Python code for `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_quiz_e2e.py` with the corrected Playwright selectors.

The original vanilla CSS style.css styling for the quiz interface has been largely replaced with Tailwind CSS utility classes, though some custom CSS classes remain in use.. The goal was to maintain the existing visual appearance and user flow, but the underlying HTML `class` attributes have changed significantly.

As a result, the Playwright test functions (`test_django_quiz_flow`, `test_specific_quiz_view`) within the file `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_views.py` need to be updated because their selectors, which relied on the old CSS class names (like `.option-button`, `.question-text`, `.results-card`), are now broken.

**Objective:**
Rewrite **only the Playwright test functions** (`test_django_quiz_flow`, `test_specific_quiz_view`) within the provided code for `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_views.py` to work with the new Tailwind CSS structure found in the updated `multi_choice_quiz` app codebase (especially the `index.html` template). The core test logic, steps, and assertions within these functions should remain the same; only the **element selectors** used by Playwright need to be updated. **Do not modify any other functions or classes (like Django TestCases) if present in the file.**

**Input:**

1.  **Original Test Code (`src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_views.py`):**
    ```python

**Prompt 5: For `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_code_display.py`**

```text
**Role:** You are an expert Python developer assisting with updating Playwright E2E tests for a Django application.

**Context:**
The `multi_choice_quiz` app in my Django project was just refactored. The original vanilla CSS style.css styling for the quiz interface has been largely replaced with Tailwind CSS utility classes, though some custom CSS classes remain in use.. This test specifically checks the display of `code` and `pre` elements within the quiz UI.

As a result, the Playwright test file `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_code_display.py` needs to be updated because its selectors for finding the *containers* of code elements (like `.question-text`, `.option-button`) are now broken. Assertions potentially checking specific CSS properties might also need review.

**Objective:**
Rewrite the provided Playwright test code in `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_code_display.py` to work with the new Tailwind CSS structure found in the updated `multi_choice_quiz` app codebase (especially the `index.html` template). The core test logic of finding `code`/`pre` elements and checking their visibility should remain, but the **selectors used to find these elements or their containers** must be updated.

**Input:**

1.  **Original Test Code (`src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_code_display.py`):**
    ```python
    # [Paste the original content of src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_code_display.py here]
    ```

2.  **Updated `multi_choice_quiz` App Codebase (with Tailwind):**
    ```python
    # [Provide the relevant updated code, especially multi_choice_quiz/templates/multi_choice_quiz/index.html]
    # [You can provide the full app directory content if easier, but index.html is key]
    ```

**Instructions:**

1.  **Identify Broken Selectors:** Analyze the original test code and identify Playwright locators targeting container elements (like `.question-text`, `.option-button`) or potentially specific styled code elements that relied on the old `style.css`.
2.  **Update Selectors:** Examine the *Updated App Codebase* (primarily `index.html`) and replace the old selectors with new ones that correctly target the same logical elements (question text container, option buttons, etc.) using the new Tailwind structure.
    *   **Priority:** Use `id` or `data-testid` attributes if available in the new HTML.
    *   **Alternative:** Use combinations of Tailwind classes or structural selectors.
    *   **Code/Pre Selectors:** Selectors targeting the `code` and `pre` tags themselves might still work (e.g., `question_text_locator.locator("code")`), but verify the *parent* locators are correct.
3.  **Review Style Assertions:** If the original test checked specific computed styles (e.g., `background-color`), verify if these checks are still relevant or need adapting to how Tailwind achieves the visual effect (e.g., checking for the presence of a specific Tailwind background class instead of the computed color).
4.  **Maintain Test Logic:** Do **not** change the overall goal of the test (verifying code element display) or the sequence of actions (navigating, finding elements).
5.  **Verify Waits:** Ensure `page.wait_for_...` calls use appropriate selectors/conditions for the new structure.

**Output:**
Provide the complete, updated Python code for `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_code_display.py` with the corrected Playwright selectors and potentially adjusted style assertions.
