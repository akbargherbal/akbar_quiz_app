# Session Context: QuizMaster Project

## Session 1 Summary (Date: 2025-05-05)

**Input:**
*   Provided codebase snapshot (`release_06.txt`).
*   Included `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` and `docs/V3_Research_Paper.md` (LGID Framework).

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Codebase & Documentation Review:** Confirmed review of the LGID paper, Testing Guide, and specifically the existing `pages/profile.html` template.
2.  **Core Motivation Clarification:** User clarified the primary drivers for the app:
    *   **Efficient Bulk Import:** The ability to quickly import large numbers of questions (`dir_import_chapter_quizzes.py`).
    *   **Personalized Learning:** Tracking user mistakes during quizzes to identify weak areas and guide review. Functionality takes priority over aesthetics.
3.  **Requirements Refinement (Stage 0):**
    *   Recognized the need to start fresh with LGID Stage 0, defining requirements for the *entire* project based on the clarified motivation.
    *   Collaboratively drafted and finalized **`Project_Requirements.md` (v2.2)**.
    *   **Priorities Shifted:** Elevated mistake capture (Phase 6) and mistake review (Phase 7) as high-priority core features. Elevated Collections (Phase 9/10) as important for organization. Deferred Favorites (Phase 12) and complex stats.
4.  **Profile Page Strategy:**
    *   Agreed the existing profile template structure (using Alpine.js tabs) is a good base.
    *   Discussed 4 static HTML mockup layouts to visualize potential improvements.
    *   **Decision:** Decided to **first update the `profile.html` template's static structure** to match a chosen layout (**Mockup 1: Stats Above Tabs** was tentatively selected) before implementing dynamic features onto it (defined as Req 9.d). Removed the "Favorites" tab from the immediate plan.
5.  **HTMX/AJAX Consideration:** Agreed to explicitly evaluate the use of HTMX/AJAX for specific interactions (Collection tab loading, collection management actions) during the implementation phases (added as evaluation points in requirements 9.g, 10.a, 10.b, 10.d).

**Current LGID Stage:**
*   **Stage 0 (Requirements Definition): COMPLETE.** The finalized `Project_Requirements.md` (v2.2) is the current blueprint.

**Plan for Next Session (Session 2):**

1.  **Confirm Next Implementation Phase:** Decide whether to start with:
    *   Confirming Phase `5.a` (adding `attempt_details` JSONField to `QuizAttempt` model) if not already done.
    *   Implementing **Phase 6** (Detailed Mistake Data Capture).
    *   *(Alternative)* Implementing **Phase 9, Step d** (Restructuring `profile.html` based on Mockup 1). *(Note: Implementing Phase 6 first aligns better with core priorities).*
2.  **Create/Update Iteration Guide:** Create the relevant `_Iteration_Guide.md` for the chosen phase (e.g., `Phase6_Iteration_Guide.md`).
3.  **Plan Implementation Steps:** Detail the specific tasks for the chosen phase within the Iteration Guide.
4.  **Begin Implementation:** Start the LGID cycle (Prompt -> Review -> Integrate -> Verify) for the first step(s) of the selected phase.

## Session 2 Summary (Date: 2025-05-06)

**Input:**
*   Session 1 Context.
*   `release_06.txt` codebase snapshot.
*   `Project_Requirements.md` (v2.2).

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Requirement Refinement (Profile Structure):** Confirmed the decision to implement the structural changes for the profile page (based on Mockup 1: Stats Above Tabs) early. Updated **`Project_Requirements.md` to v2.3**, integrating the profile restructure task (Req 5.f, 5.h) into Phase 5 and removing it from Phase 9.
2.  **Testing Strategy Clarification (Phase Verification):**
    *   Discussed how to handle phase verification tests without conflicting with original `core/tests/test_phase*.py` files.
    *   Agreed on a strategy: Create dedicated phase verification modules within the relevant app's test directory, organized by feature (e.g., `src/pages/tests/user_profile/test_phase5_verification.py`).
    *   Updated **`Project_Requirements.md` to v2.4**, revising the Non-Functional Requirements section (Sec 4) to reflect this structured verification approach and emphasize adherence to `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md`.
3.  **Iteration Guide Strategy & Creation:**
    *   Agreed to use a **single, multi-phase Iteration Guide** for the upcoming profile and core feature work (Phases 5-11), rather than one guide per phase.
    *   Decided to locate this guide in `src/docs/`.
    *   Created the **`src/docs/Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`** document.
    *   Populated this guide with the detailed plan for the **revised Phase 5**, using the Standard Iteration Guide template but adjusting the detail level in "Key Tasks" as requested.
    *   Added placeholder sections for Phases 6-11 to the guide.

**Current LGID Stage:**
*   **Phase 5 (Revised): Planned.** The detailed plan is documented in `src/docs/Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`.

**Plan for Next Session (Session 3):**

1.  Begin implementation of **Phase 5 (Revised)**, starting with **Step 5.1: Add `attempt_details` JSONField to `QuizAttempt` Model** as detailed in the `Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`.
2.  Follow the LGID cycle for Step 5.1: Generate code -> Review -> Integrate -> Verify (add unit test, run checks/tests).
3.  Proceed to subsequent steps in Phase 5 as documented in the Iteration Guide.
