# Session Context: QuizMaster Project

## Session 1 Summary (Date: 2025-05-05)

**Input:**

- Provided codebase snapshot (`release_06.txt`).
- Included `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` and `docs/V3_Research_Paper.md` (LGID Framework).

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Codebase & Documentation Review:** Confirmed review of the LGID paper, Testing Guide, and specifically the existing `pages/profile.html` template.
2.  **Core Motivation Clarification:** User clarified the primary drivers for the app:
    - **Efficient Bulk Import:** The ability to quickly import large numbers of questions (`dir_import_chapter_quizzes.py`).
    - **Personalized Learning:** Tracking user mistakes during quizzes to identify weak areas and guide review. Functionality takes priority over aesthetics.
3.  **Requirements Refinement (Stage 0):**
    - Recognized the need to start fresh with LGID Stage 0, defining requirements for the _entire_ project based on the clarified motivation.
    - Collaboratively drafted and finalized **`Project_Requirements.md` (v2.2)**.
    - **Priorities Shifted:** Elevated mistake capture (Phase 6) and mistake review (Phase 7) as high-priority core features. Elevated Collections (Phase 9/10) as important for organization. Deferred Favorites (Phase 12) and complex stats.
4.  **Profile Page Strategy:**
    - Agreed the existing profile template structure (using Alpine.js tabs) is a good base.
    - Discussed 4 static HTML mockup layouts to visualize potential improvements.
    - **Decision:** Decided to **first update the `profile.html` template's static structure** to match a chosen layout (**Mockup 1: Stats Above Tabs** was tentatively selected) before implementing dynamic features onto it (defined as Req 9.d). Removed the "Favorites" tab from the immediate plan.
5.  **HTMX/AJAX Consideration:** Agreed to explicitly evaluate the use of HTMX/AJAX for specific interactions (Collection tab loading, collection management actions) during the implementation phases (added as evaluation points in requirements 9.g, 10.a, 10.b, 10.d).

**Current LGID Stage:**

- **Stage 0 (Requirements Definition): COMPLETE.** The finalized `Project_Requirements.md` (v2.2) is the current blueprint.

**Plan for Next Session (Session 2):**

1.  **Confirm Next Implementation Phase:** Decide whether to start with:
    - Confirming Phase `5.a` (adding `attempt_details` JSONField to `QuizAttempt` model) if not already done.
    - Implementing **Phase 6** (Detailed Mistake Data Capture).
    - _(Alternative)_ Implementing **Phase 9, Step d** (Restructuring `profile.html` based on Mockup 1). _(Note: Implementing Phase 6 first aligns better with core priorities)._
2.  **Create/Update Iteration Guide:** Create the relevant `_Iteration_Guide.md` for the chosen phase (e.g., `Phase6_Iteration_Guide.md`).
3.  **Plan Implementation Steps:** Detail the specific tasks for the chosen phase within the Iteration Guide.
4.  **Begin Implementation:** Start the LGID cycle (Prompt -> Review -> Integrate -> Verify) for the first step(s) of the selected phase.

## Session 2 Summary (Date: 2025-05-06)

**Input:**

- Session 1 Context.
- `release_06.txt` codebase snapshot.
- `Project_Requirements.md` (v2.2).

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Requirement Refinement (Profile Structure):** Confirmed the decision to implement the structural changes for the profile page (based on Mockup 1: Stats Above Tabs) early. Updated **`Project_Requirements.md` to v2.3**, integrating the profile restructure task (Req 5.f, 5.h) into Phase 5 and removing it from Phase 9.
2.  **Testing Strategy Clarification (Phase Verification):**
    - Discussed how to handle phase verification tests without conflicting with original `core/tests/test_phase*.py` files.
    - Agreed on a strategy: Create dedicated phase verification modules within the relevant app's test directory, organized by feature (e.g., `src/pages/tests/user_profile/test_phase5_verification.py`).
    - Updated **`Project_Requirements.md` to v2.4**, revising the Non-Functional Requirements section (Sec 4) to reflect this structured verification approach and emphasize adherence to `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md`.
3.  **Iteration Guide Strategy & Creation:**
    - Agreed to use a **single, multi-phase Iteration Guide** for the upcoming profile and core feature work (Phases 5-11), rather than one guide per phase.
    - Decided to locate this guide in `src/docs/`.
    - Created the **`src/docs/Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`** document.
    - Populated this guide with the detailed plan for the **revised Phase 5**, using the Standard Iteration Guide template but adjusting the detail level in "Key Tasks" as requested.
    - Added placeholder sections for Phases 6-11 to the guide.

**Current LGID Stage:**

- **Phase 5 (Revised): Planned.** The detailed plan is documented in `src/docs/Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`.

**Plan for Next Session (Session 3):**

1.  Begin implementation of **Phase 5 (Revised)**, starting with **Step 5.1: Add `attempt_details` JSONField to `QuizAttempt` Model** as detailed in the `Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`.
2.  Follow the LGID cycle for Step 5.1: Generate code -> Review -> Integrate -> Verify (add unit test, run checks/tests).
3.  Proceed to subsequent steps in Phase 5 as documented in the Iteration Guide.

## Session 3 Summary (Date: 2025-05-07/08)

**Input:**

- Session 2 Context.
- `release_06.txt` codebase snapshot.
- `Project_Requirements.md` (v2.4).
- `Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`.
- `mockup_01.html`.

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Confirmed Understanding:** Reviewed and confirmed understanding of the Session 2 context, the target profile mockup (`mockup_01.html`), and the detailed plan for Phase 5 in the Iteration Guide.
2.  **Version Control Setup:** Created a new feature branch `feature/phase5-profile-foundation` from `main`.
3.  **Implemented Phase 5, Step 5.1:**
    - Added the `attempt_details` `JSONField` (nullable, blankable) to the `QuizAttempt` model in `multi_choice_quiz/models.py`.
    - Generated and applied the corresponding database migration.
    - Added a unit test (`test_attempt_details_field_exists_and_accepts_data`) to `multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_models.py` verifying the field's existence and behavior.
    - Confirmed alignment with `TESTING_GUIDE.md`.
    - Committed the changes for Step 5.1.
4.  **Implemented Phase 5, Step 5.2:**
    - Implemented the basic `submit_quiz_attempt` view function in `multi_choice_quiz/views.py` to handle POST requests, validate basic data, and save `QuizAttempt` instances (initially ignoring `attempt_details`). Added necessary imports and `@csrf_exempt`, `@require_POST` decorators.
    - Added the URL pattern for the new view in `multi_choice_quiz/urls.py`.
    - Verified the implementation by running the existing `SubmitQuizAttemptViewTests` in `multi_choice_quiz/tests/test_views.py`, adjusting one assertion (`test_submit_invalid_end_time_format`) to match the actual error message returned by the view.
    - Committed the changes for Step 5.2.

**Current LGID Stage:**

- **Phase 5 (Revised): In Progress.** Steps 5.1 and 5.2 are complete and committed to the `feature/phase5-profile-foundation` branch.

**Plan for Next Session (Session 4):**

1.  Continue implementation of **Phase 5 (Revised)**, starting with **Step 5.3: Ensure Frontend Sends Basic Results**.
    - Modify `multi_choice_quiz/static/multi_choice_quiz/app.js` to gather and POST results.
    - Update `multi_choice_quiz/templates/multi_choice_quiz/index.html` to ensure `quiz_id` is available to the JavaScript.
2.  Perform verification for Step 5.3 (Manual E2E check).
3.  Proceed to subsequent steps in Phase 5 (Steps 5.4 - 5.7) as documented in the `Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`.

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Implemented Phase 5, Step 5.3:**
    - Modified `multi_choice_quiz/templates/multi_choice_quiz/index.html` to add `data-quiz-id` attribute.
    - Modified `multi_choice_quiz/static/multi_choice_quiz/app.js` to read `quizId`, create `submitResults()` function, and call it on quiz completion.
    - Verified via user-provided console logs and admin screenshot showing successful POST requests and `QuizAttempt` creation for both anonymous and logged-in users.
    - User committed changes for Step 5.3.
2.  **Verified Phase 5, Step 5.4:**
    - Reviewed existing `pages/views.py::profile_view` and `pages/urls.py` mapping for `/profile/`. Confirmed they met requirements.
    - Verified by running `pytest pages/tests/test_views.py` which passed. No code changes needed.
3.  **Implemented Phase 5, Step 5.5:**
    - Modified `pages/templates/pages/profile.html` based on provided `mockup_01.html` to implement the "Stats Above Tabs" structure. Moved stats cards, removed Favorites/Created tabs, added Collections tab (static), integrated dynamic history loop into new structure.
    - Verified via user-provided screenshot and confirmation that the structure rendered correctly and tab switching worked.
4.  **Verified Phase 5, Step 5.6:**
    - User confirmed manual responsive checks passed.
    - Updated `pages/tests/test_responsive.py::test_profile_responsive_layout` to include new locators and assertions verifying the Mockup 1 structure (Stats section, correct tabs, tab switching) across all breakpoints.
    - Verified by running the updated `test_profile_responsive_layout` test which passed.
5.  **Implemented Phase 5, Step 5.7:**
    - Created directory `src/pages/tests/user_profile/`.
    - Created verification script `src/pages/tests/user_profile/test_phase5_verification.py` with tests for `attempt_details` field, profile login requirement, and basic Mockup 1 structure rendering.
    - Debugged and fixed initial test failures (`AssertionError` on tab button check, `NameError` for missing `resolve` import).
    - Verified by running the final `test_phase5_verification.py` script, which passed.

**Current LGID Stage:**

- **Phase 5 (Revised): COMPLETE.** All steps (5.1 - 5.7) are implemented, verified, and committed to the `feature/phase5-profile-foundation` branch.

**Plan for Next Session (Session 5):**

1.  Merge the `feature/phase5-profile-foundation` branch into `main` (or equivalent development branch).
2.  Create a new feature branch for Phase 6 (e.g., `feature/phase6-mistake-capture`).
3.  Begin implementation of **Phase 6: Detailed Mistake Data Capture**, starting with **Step 6.1: Frontend Data Collection (`app.js`)** as detailed in the Iteration Guide.
4.  Follow the LGID cycle for Step 6.1: Generate/Modify code -> Review -> Integrate -> Verify (manual check or JS unit test).
5.  Proceed to subsequent steps in Phase 6 (6.2, 6.3, 6.4).

## Session 5 Summary (Date: 2025-05-08)

**Input:**

-   Session 4 Context.
-   `release_06.txt` codebase snapshot (containing committed changes for Phase 5).
-   `Project_Requirements.md` (v2.4).
-   `Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`.

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Addressed Test Breakage:** Identified and fixed the failing test (`test_profile_page_structure_when_authenticated`) in `src/pages/tests/test_templates.py` that broke due to the profile page restructure in Phase 5. The test assertions were updated to match the implemented Mockup 1 structure (Collections tab instead of Favorites). Confirmed tests passed after the fix.
2.  **Git Workflow:** Discussed and provided Git commands for merging the completed `feature/phase5-profile-foundation` branch into `main`. User confirmed merge was successful.
3.  **Created Branch for Phase 6:** User created `feature/phase6-mistake-capture` branch.
4.  **Implemented Phase 6, Step 6.1:**
    *   Modified `multi_choice_quiz/static/multi_choice_quiz/app.js` to add `detailedAnswers` state and populate it with `{questionId: selectedOptionIndex}` pairs in the `selectOption` method. Added state reset in `init()` and `restartQuiz()`.
    *   Verified via console logs.
5.  **Implemented Phase 6, Step 6.2:**
    *   Modified `multi_choice_quiz/static/multi_choice_quiz/app.js` to include the `detailedAnswers` object in the `payload` sent by the `submitResults` function.
    *   Verified via console and server logs showing the payload included `attempt_details`.
6.  **Implemented Phase 6, Step 6.3:**
    *   Modified `multi_choice_quiz/views.py::submit_quiz_attempt` view to:
        *   Safely extract `attempt_details` from the incoming JSON payload.
        *   Fetch correct answers for the relevant quiz questions.
        *   Compare received user answers against correct answers.
        *   Generate a `mistakes_data` dictionary containing only the incorrect answers in the required format (`{qid_str: {'user_answer_idx': X, 'correct_answer_idx': Y}}`).
        *   Save the generated `mistakes_data` (or `None` if no mistakes/no details received) to the `QuizAttempt.attempt_details` JSONField.
    *   Verified via server logs showing correct mistake identification and storage message.
7.  **Implemented Phase 6, Step 6.4:**
    *   Created directory `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/mistake_tracking/`.
    *   Created verification script `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/mistake_tracking/test_phase6_verification.py`.
    *   Added tests verifying correct storage of mistakes, handling of perfect scores (no mistakes stored), and graceful handling of submissions without the `attempt_details` field.
    *   Verified by running the `test_phase6_verification.py` script, which passed.

**Current LGID Stage:**

-   **Phase 6 (Detailed Mistake Data Capture): COMPLETE.** All steps (6.1 - 6.4) are implemented, verified, and presumably committed to the `feature/phase6-mistake-capture` branch (pending merge).

**Plan for Next Session (Session 6):**

1.  **(Optional but Recommended) Merge:** Merge the `feature/phase6-mistake-capture` branch into `main` (or equivalent development branch).
2.  **Create Branch:** Create a new feature branch for Phase 7 (e.g., `feature/phase7-mistake-review`).
3.  **Begin Implementation:** Start **Phase 7: Basic Mistake Review Interface**, commencing with **Step 7.1: Create `attempt_mistake_review` View** as detailed in the `Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`. This involves creating the view function, adding the URL pattern, implementing logic to fetch the attempt and mistake data, and preparing the context for the template.
