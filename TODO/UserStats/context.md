# Session Context: QuizMaster Project

## Session 1 Summary (Date: 2025-05-05)

**Input:**

- Provided codebase snapshot (`release_06.txt`).
- Included `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` and `docs/V3_Research_Paper.md` (LGID Framework).

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Codebase & Documentation Review:** Confirmed review of the LGID paper, Testing Guide, and specifically the existing `pages/profile.html` template.
2.  **Core Motivation Clarification:** User clarified the primary drivers for the app:
    - **Efficient Bulk Import:** The ability to quickly import large numbers of questions (`dir_import_chapter_quizzes.py`).
    - **Personalized Learning:** Tracking user mistakes during quizzes to identify weak areas and guide review. Functionality takes priority over aesthetics.
3.  **Requirements Refinement (Stage 0):**
    - Recognized the need to start fresh with LGID Stage 0, defining requirements for the _entire_ project based on the clarified motivation.
    - Collaboratively drafted and finalized **`Project_Requirements.md` (v2.2)**.
    - **Priorities Shifted:** Elevated mistake capture (Phase 6) and mistake review (Phase 7) as high-priority core features. Elevated Collections (Phase 9/10) as important for organization. Deferred Favorites (Phase 12) and complex stats.
4.  **Profile Page Strategy:**
    - Agreed the existing profile template structure (using Alpine.js tabs) is a good base.
    - Discussed 4 static HTML mockup layouts to visualize potential improvements.
    - **Decision:** Decided to **first update the `profile.html` template's static structure** to match a chosen layout (**Mockup 1: Stats Above Tabs** was tentatively selected) before implementing dynamic features onto it (defined as Req 9.d). Removed the "Favorites" tab from the immediate plan.
5.  **HTMX/AJAX Consideration:** Agreed to explicitly evaluate the use of HTMX/AJAX for specific interactions (Collection tab loading, collection management actions) during the implementation phases (added as evaluation points in requirements 9.g, 10.a, 10.b, 10.d).

**Current LGID Stage:**

- **Stage 0 (Requirements Definition): COMPLETE.** The finalized `Project_Requirements.md` (v2.2) is the current blueprint.

**Plan for Next Session (Session 2):**

1.  **Confirm Next Implementation Phase:** Decide whether to start with:
    - Confirming Phase `5.a` (adding `attempt_details` JSONField to `QuizAttempt` model) if not already done.
    - Implementing **Phase 6** (Detailed Mistake Data Capture).
    - _(Alternative)_ Implementing **Phase 9, Step d** (Restructuring `profile.html` based on Mockup 1). _(Note: Implementing Phase 6 first aligns better with core priorities)._
2.  **Create/Update Iteration Guide:** Create the relevant `_Iteration_Guide.md` for the chosen phase (e.g., `Phase6_Iteration_Guide.md`).
3.  **Plan Implementation Steps:** Detail the specific tasks for the chosen phase within the Iteration Guide.
4.  **Begin Implementation:** Start the LGID cycle (Prompt -> Review -> Integrate -> Verify) for the first step(s) of the selected phase.

## Session 2 Summary (Date: 2025-05-06)

**Input:**

- Session 1 Context.
- `release_06.txt` codebase snapshot.
- `Project_Requirements.md` (v2.2).

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Requirement Refinement (Profile Structure):** Confirmed the decision to implement the structural changes for the profile page (based on Mockup 1: Stats Above Tabs) early. Updated **`Project_Requirements.md` to v2.3**, integrating the profile restructure task (Req 5.f, 5.h) into Phase 5 and removing it from Phase 9.
2.  **Testing Strategy Clarification (Phase Verification):**
    - Discussed how to handle phase verification tests without conflicting with original `core/tests/test_phase*.py` files.
    - Agreed on a strategy: Create dedicated phase verification modules within the relevant app's test directory, organized by feature (e.g., `src/pages/tests/user_profile/test_phase5_verification.py`).
    - Updated **`Project_Requirements.md` to v2.4**, revising the Non-Functional Requirements section (Sec 4) to reflect this structured verification approach and emphasize adherence to `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md`.
3.  **Iteration Guide Strategy & Creation:**
    - Agreed to use a **single, multi-phase Iteration Guide** for the upcoming profile and core feature work (Phases 5-11), rather than one guide per phase.
    - Decided to locate this guide in `src/docs/`.
    - Created the **`src/docs/Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`** document.
    - Populated this guide with the detailed plan for the **revised Phase 5**, using the Standard Iteration Guide template but adjusting the detail level in "Key Tasks" as requested.
    - Added placeholder sections for Phases 6-11 to the guide.

**Current LGID Stage:**

- **Phase 5 (Revised): Planned.** The detailed plan is documented in `src/docs/Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`.

**Plan for Next Session (Session 3):**

1.  Begin implementation of **Phase 5 (Revised)**, starting with **Step 5.1: Add `attempt_details` JSONField to `QuizAttempt` Model** as detailed in the `Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`.
2.  Follow the LGID cycle for Step 5.1: Generate code -> Review -> Integrate -> Verify (add unit test, run checks/tests).
3.  Proceed to subsequent steps in Phase 5 as documented in the Iteration Guide.

3.  **Implemented Phase 5, Step 5.5:**
    - Modified `pages/templates/pages/profile.html` based on provided `mockup_01.html` to implement the "Stats Above Tabs" structure. Moved stats cards, removed Favorites/Created tabs, added Collections tab (static), integrated dynamic history loop into new structure.
    - Verified via user-provided screenshot and confirmation that the structure rendered correctly and tab switching worked.
4.  **Verified Phase 5, Step 5.6:**
    - User confirmed manual responsive checks passed.
    - Updated `pages/tests/test_responsive.py::test_profile_responsive_layout` to include new locators and assertions verifying the Mockup 1 structure (Stats section, correct tabs, tab switching) across all breakpoints.
    - Verified by running the updated `test_profile_responsive_layout` test which passed.
5.  **Implemented Phase 5, Step 5.7:**
    - Created directory `src/pages/tests/user_profile/`.

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Addressed Test Breakage:** Identified and fixed the failing test (`test_profile_page_structure_when_authenticated`) in `src/pages/tests/test_templates.py` that broke due to the profile page restructure in Phase 5. The test assertions were updated to match the implemented Mockup 1 structure (Collections tab instead of Favorites). Confirmed tests passed after the fix.
2.  **Git Workflow:** Discussed and provided Git commands for merging the completed `feature/phase5-profile-foundation` branch into `main`. User confirmed merge was successful.
3.  **Created Branch for Phase 6:** User created `feature/phase6-mistake-capture` branch.
4.  **Implemented Phase 6, Step 6.1:**
    *   Modified `multi_choice_quiz/static/multi_choice_quiz/app.js` to add `detailedAnswers` state and populate it with `{questionId: selectedOptionIndex}` pairs in the `selectOption` method. Added state reset in `init()` and `restartQuiz()`.
    *   Verified via console logs.
5.  **Implemented Phase 6, Step 6.2:**
    *   Modified `multi_choice_quiz/static/multi_choice_quiz/app.js` to include the `detailedAnswers` object in the `payload` sent by the `submitResults` function.
    *   Verified via console and server logs showing the payload included `attempt_details`.
6.  **Implemented Phase 6, Step 6.3:**
    *   Modified `multi_choice_quiz/views.py::submit_quiz_attempt` view to:
        *   Safely extract `attempt_details` from the incoming JSON payload.
        *   Fetch correct answers for the relevant quiz questions.
        *   Compare received user answers against correct answers.
        *   Generate a `mistakes_data` dictionary containing only the incorrect answers in the required format (`{qid_str: {'user_answer_idx': X, 'correct_answer_idx': Y}}`).
        *   Save the generated `mistakes_data` (or `None` if no mistakes/no details received) to the `QuizAttempt.attempt_details` JSONField.
    *   Verified via server logs showing correct mistake identification and storage message.
7.  **Implemented Phase 6, Step 6.4:**
    *   Created directory `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/mistake_tracking/`.
    *   Created verification script `src/multi_choice_quiz/tests/mistake_tracking/test_phase6_verification.py`.
    *   Added tests verifying correct storage of mistakes, handling of perfect scores (no mistakes stored), and graceful handling of submissions without the `attempt_details` field.
    *   Verified by running the `test_phase6_verification.py` script, which passed.

**Current LGID Stage:**

-   **Phase 6 (Detailed Mistake Data Capture): COMPLETE.** All steps (6.1 - 6.4) are implemented, verified, and presumably committed to the `feature/phase6-mistake-capture` branch (pending merge).

**Plan for Next Session (Session 6):**

1.  **(Optional but Recommended) Merge:** Merge the `feature/phase6-mistake-capture` branch into `main` (or equivalent development branch).
2.  **Create Branch:** Create a new feature branch for Phase 7 (e.g., `feature/phase7-mistake-review`).
3.  **Begin Implementation:** Start **Phase 7: Basic Mistake Review Interface**, commencing with **Step 7.1: Create `attempt_mistake_review` View** as detailed in the `Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`. This involves creating the view function, adding the URL pattern, implementing logic to fetch the attempt and mistake data, and preparing the context for the template.

2.  **Implemented Phase 7, Step 7.1:**
    *   Created the `attempt_mistake_review` view in `multi_choice_quiz/views.py` with logic to fetch the attempt, check ownership, parse `attempt_details`, retrieve questions/options, and prepare context. Added `@login_required`. Handled redirects for attempts with no mistakes. Imported `messages`.
    *   Added the URL pattern `/attempt/<int:attempt_id>/review/` in `multi_choice_quiz/urls.py`.
    *   Added unit tests to `test_views.py` verifying access control, 404s, redirects for no-mistake attempts, and basic context data. Confirmed tests passed.
3.  **Implemented Phase 7, Step 7.2:**
    *   Created the `multi_choice_quiz/templates/multi_choice_quiz/mistake_review.html` template to display the quiz title, attempt timestamp, and loop through mistake details showing question text, user answer, and correct answer.
    *   Verified template creation resolved the `TemplateDoesNotExist` error in the previous tests.
4.  **Implemented Phase 7, Step 7.3:**
    *   Modified `pages/templates/pages/profile.html` to conditionally display the "Review Mistakes" link in the history list only `{% if attempt.attempt_details %}`.
    *   Verified manually via screenshot showing the link appearing/disappearing correctly based on attempt data.
5.  **Implemented Phase 7, Step 7.4:**

## Session 8 Summary (Date: 2025-05-09)

**Input:**

*   Session 7 Context.
*   Codebase snapshot (containing committed changes for Phases 5, 6, 7, 8).
*   `Project_Requirements.md` (v2.5).
*   `Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`.

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **(Git Workflow):** Created `feature/phase9-collections-profile` branch.
2.  **Implemented Phase 9, Step 9.1 (Models):**
    *   Defined `SystemCategory` and `UserCollection` models in `pages/models.py`.
    *   Applied migrations.
    *   Added unit tests in `pages/tests/test_models.py` and confirmed they passed after fixing an `IntegrityError` issue related to unique constraints and transaction management during testing.
3.  **Implemented Phase 9, Step 9.2 (Admin):**
    *   Registered `SystemCategory` and `UserCollection` in `pages/admin.py` with basic customizations (`list_display`, `search_fields`, `filter_horizontal`, etc.).
    *   Verified manually via the Django admin interface.
4.  **Implemented Phase 9, Step 9.3 (Profile View Logic):**
    *   Updated `pages/views.py::profile_view` to fetch `UserCollection`s (with prefetching) and calculate basic stats (total attempts, average score).
    *   Added updated data (`user_collections`, `stats`) to the context.
    *   Updated unit tests in `pages/tests/test_views.py` to verify the new context data, fixing an assertion error related to test setup.
5.  **Implemented Phase 9, Step 9.4 (Profile Template Population):**
    *   Updated `pages/templates/pages/profile.html` to dynamically display the stats and user collections fetched in Step 9.3.
    *   Verified manually using the `akbar` superuser (after creating collections via admin) and confirmed correct rendering.
6.  **Implemented Phase 9, Step 9.5 (Quizzes View/Template Update):**
    *   Updated `pages/views.py::quizzes` view to fetch/filter by `SystemCategory` slugs and added pagination.
    *   Updated `pages/templates/pages/quizzes.html` to use `SystemCategory` for filters and display category tags on quizzes. Verified manually.
    *   Updated tests in `pages/tests/test_views.py`. Encountered `AssertionError` related to the expected number of categories (fixed) and then another `AssertionError` related to the exact string rendered for the "Showing quizzes..." message (fixed). **A final test run still failed** on `test_quizzes_page_loads_and_filters_by_category`, indicating an issue with the assertion about the number of quizzes expected after filtering, potentially related to pagination or test setup details.
7.  **Implemented Phase 9, Step 9.6 (Homepage Update):**
    *   Updated `pages/views.py::home` view to fetch popular `SystemCategory` instances based on active quiz count.
    *   Updated `pages/templates/pages/home.html` to display these popular categories.
    *   Updated tests in `pages/tests/test_views.py`. Encountered `AssertionError` related to exact ordering of featured quizzes (fixed using `assertSetEqual`). Encountered another `AssertionError` related to the rendering of pluralized quiz counts (fixed assertion to match `pluralize` tag output). **Tests still failed** on the subsequent run, again within `test_quizzes_page_loads_and_filters_by_category`.

**Current LGID Stage:**

*   **Phase 9 (Collections, Profile, Browsing): In Progress.** Steps 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 completed. Steps 9.5 and 9.6 have code implemented, but verification via unit tests in `pages/tests/test_views.py` is **blocked by recurring test failures**, specifically in `test_quizzes_page_loads_and_filters_by_category` and potentially masked issues in `test_home_page_loads`.

**Plan for Next Session (Session 9):**

1.  **Troubleshoot Failing Tests:** Focus *exclusively* on debugging and fixing the failing tests in `src/pages/tests/test_views.py`:
    *   Carefully re-examine the `setUpTestData` logic against the view queries (filtering, ordering, pagination) for both the `/` (home) and `/quizzes/` views.
    *   Analyze the failing assertions in `test_quizzes_page_loads_and_filters_by_category` and `test_home_page_loads` to pinpoint the exact mismatch (context data vs. expectation, or rendered HTML vs. expectation).
    *   Use print statements or a debugger within the test or view if necessary to inspect context values and query results during test execution.
2.  **Complete Verification for 9.5 & 9.6:** Ensure all tests in `pages/tests/test_views.py` pass reliably.
3.  **Proceed:** Once tests pass, move to **Step 9.7: Implement Basic Edit Profile**.

## Session 9 Summary (Date: 2025-05-09)

**Input:**

*   Session 8 Context.
*   Codebase snapshot (containing committed changes for Phases 5, 6, 7, 8).
*   `Project_Requirements.md` (v2.5).
*   `Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`.

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Troubleshooting Failing Tests (Phase 9.5 & 9.6):**
    *   Identified an `AttributeError` in `pages/tests/test_views.py::test_quizzes_page_loads_and_filters_by_category` due to a misnamed test variable (`self.quiz_a2` vs `self.quiz_inactive`). Corrected the test.
    *   Identified a subsequent `AssertionError` in `test_home_page_loads` due to non-deterministic ordering of `Quiz` objects with identical `created_at` timestamps in `setUpTestData`.
    *   Resolved this by adding `"-id"` as a secondary ordering criterion to `order_by("-created_at", "-id")` in the `home` and `quizzes` views in `pages/views.py`.
    *   Confirmed all tests in `pages/tests/test_views.py` passed after these fixes.
2.  **Implemented Phase 9, Step 9.7 (Basic Edit Profile - Req 9.h, 9.i):**
    *   Created `EditProfileForm` in `pages/forms.py` for email updates.
    *   Implemented `edit_profile_view` in `pages/views.py` with GET/POST logic and messages.
    *   Added URL pattern for `/profile/edit/` in `pages/urls.py`.
    *   Created `pages/templates/pages/edit_profile.html` template.
    *   Updated the "Edit Profile" link in `pages/templates/pages/profile.html`.
3.  **Implemented Phase 9, Step 9.8 (Phase 9 Verification):**
    *   Created `src/pages/tests/user_profile/test_phase9_verification.py`.
    *   Added tests for edit profile functionality (GET, POST, login requirement, messages).
    *   Added placeholder/integration tests verifying dynamic stats/collections display on profile, `SystemCategory` filtering on the quizzes page, and `SystemCategory` display on the homepage.
    *   Confirmed all tests in `test_phase9_verification.py` passed.
4.  **Phase 9 Completion:**
    *   Steps 9.a-9.i are now considered complete and verified.
    *   Requirement 9.j (UX Evaluation for HTMX/AJAX for "Collections" tab loading) was evaluated: Decided to defer HTMX/AJAX implementation for this tab, as direct rendering is acceptable for now. This decision is documented.
    *   Marked Phase 9 as **COMPLETE**.

**Current LGID Stage:**

*   **Phase 9 (Collection Models, Profile Population & Public Browsing): COMPLETE.** All implementation steps verified.

**Plan for Next Session (Session 10):**

1.  **(Git Workflow):**
    *   Ensure all Phase 9 changes are committed to `feature/phase9-collections-profile`.
    *   Merge `feature/phase9-collections-profile` into the main development branch.
    *   Create a new feature branch for Phase 10 (e.g., `feature/phase10-collection-mgmt`).
2.  **Begin Implementation:** Start **Phase 10: User Collection Management & Import Integration**, commencing with **Step 10.1: Implement `UserCollection` Creation** as detailed in the `Profile_and_CoreFeatures_Iteration_Guide.md`.
    *   This will involve adding a "Create New" button to the "Collections" tab on the profile page.
    *   Implementing a form and view for creating new `UserCollection` instances.
    *   Deciding whether to use HTMX/AJAX for this interaction or a full page reload (Req 10.a evaluation).
3.  Follow the LGID cycle for subsequent steps in Phase 10.
