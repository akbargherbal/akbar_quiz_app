Okay, that's good news that login and logout are functionally working! It means the core Django authentication mechanisms (`django.contrib.auth.urls`) are likely being hit correctly, possibly despite the confusing setup we identified.

Given that users *can* currently log in, the critical things that still need to be done are primarily about **removing the confusing and potentially problematic placeholder elements** and ensuring the standard Django flow is used consistently:

1.  **Correct `LOGIN_URL` in `settings.py`:**
    *   **Problem:** `LOGIN_URL = '/login/'` points to your placeholder view (`pages.views.login_view`), which doesn't handle the actual login logic. When `@login_required` redirects, it sends users to a non-functional target *for the redirect purpose*.
    *   **Critical Fix:** Change this setting to point to the URL name of Django's *actual* login view.
        ```python
        # src/core/settings.py
        # ...
        # LOGIN_URL = '/login/'  # <<< REMOVE OR COMMENT OUT THIS LINE
        LOGIN_URL = 'login'      # <<< ADD THIS LINE (uses the default 'login' URL name from auth.urls)
        # ...
        # Ensure LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL is also sensible (e.g., '/')
        LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = "/"
        LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = "/"
        ```
        *Why 'login'?* Because `django.contrib.auth.urls` defines the built-in login view with the URL name `'login'`, typically mapped to the path `accounts/login/`. Setting `LOGIN_URL = 'login'` tells Django to redirect unauthorized users to the correct, functional login page provided by `django.contrib.auth`.

2.  **Remove the Placeholder Login View and URL:**
    *   **Problem:** The `pages.views.login_view` and the corresponding URL pattern in `pages/urls.py` (`path("login/", views.login_view, name="login")`) serve no purpose if you're using the built-in authentication and create confusion. The `name="login"` here also clashes with the built-in URL name.
    *   **Critical Fix:**
        *   Delete the `login_view` function from `src/pages/views.py`.
        *   Delete the `path("login/", views.login_view, name="login"),` line from `src/pages/urls.py`.

3.  **Use the Standard Template Location for Login:**
    *   **Problem:** Django's built-in login view (`django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView`) expects the login template to be at `registration/login.html` by default. Your current template is `pages/templates/pages/login.html`.
    *   **Critical Fix (Choose ONE):**
        *   **Option A (Recommended - Standard Practice):**
            *   Create a `templates/registration/` directory at the project root level (alongside `pages`, `multi_choice_quiz`).
            *   Move or copy `src/pages/templates/pages/login.html` to `src/templates/registration/login.html`.
            *   Update `settings.py` to include this top-level `templates` directory in `TEMPLATES['DIRS']`:
                ```python
                # src/core/settings.py
                TEMPLATES = [
                    {
                        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
                        'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'templates'], # <<< ADD THIS LINE
                        'APP_DIRS': True,
                        # ... rest of options ...
                    },
                ]
                ```
        *   **Option B (Less Standard):** Keep the template where it is (`pages/templates/pages/login.html`) but explicitly tell the built-in login view to use it. You would do this in `core/urls.py` where you include `django.contrib.auth.urls`:
            ```python
            # src/core/urls.py
            from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views

            urlpatterns = [
                # ... other paths
                # Instead of just include('django.contrib.auth.urls')...
                path('accounts/login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='pages/login.html'), name='login'),
                path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')), # Include the rest
                # ... other paths
            ]
            ```
            *(Option A is generally preferred for maintainability).*

4.  **Remove Misleading Notice from Template:**
    *   **Problem:** The login template (`pages/login.html`) contains a notice saying login is not implemented.
    *   **Critical Fix:** Delete the "Non-functional notice" div from the bottom of `src/pages/templates/pages/login.html` (or its new location at `templates/registration/login.html`).

By making these changes, you align your application with Django's standard authentication flow, making it more robust, maintainable, and less confusing. The login process will reliably use the built-in views and redirect correctly when needed.
