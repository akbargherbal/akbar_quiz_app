Okay, let's break down these test failures. It seems like completing Phase 5 introduced some regressions or highlighted issues in the E2E tests and a couple of backend/integration tests.

Here's an analysis of the failures based on the logs and your codebase:

**Core Issue: Static Files Manifest Error (Likely Cause for Many E2E Failures)**

*   **Evidence:** The log snippet for `QuizViewTests.test_quiz_detail_view_loads` contains: `ERROR 2025-05-03 22:04:31,469 views Error loading quiz 1: Missing staticfiles manifest entry for 'multi_choice_quiz/app.js'`
*   **Explanation:** Your `settings.py` uses `whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage`. This storage backend requires a manifest file (`staticfiles.json` by default) generated by running `python manage.py collectstatic`. This manifest maps original static file names (like `multi_choice_quiz/app.js`) to their hashed versions (e.g., `multi_choice_quiz/app.1234abcd.js`) for efficient caching. The error indicates this manifest is missing or doesn't contain an entry for `app.js`.
*   **Impact:** If the manifest is missing/incomplete, Django can't find the correct URL for `app.js` when using the `{% static %}` template tag. This means `app.js` (your Alpine.js component logic) won't load in the browser during the tests.
*   **Affected Tests:** This likely causes the failures in:
    *   `test_code_elements_display_correctly`: Fails waiting for JS-driven progress indicator updates.
    *   `test_database_quiz_flow`: Fails waiting for the `.correct-answer` class added by JS.
    *   `test_mistakes_review_overflow`: Fails waiting for the progress indicator managed by JS.
    *   `test_mistakes_review_overflow_bounding_box`: Fails waiting for the progress indicator managed by JS.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Run `collectstatic`:** Execute `python manage.py collectstatic` in your `src` directory. Make sure `STATIC_ROOT` is defined correctly in `settings.py` (it seems to be `BASE_DIR / "staticfiles"`). This should generate the `staticfiles.json` manifest in the `src/staticfiles/` directory.
    2.  **Ensure `STATIC_ROOT` exists:** Although `collectstatic` creates it, ensure the `staticfiles` directory exists at the root of your `src` directory if you encounter permissions issues.

**Failure 1: `QuizViewTests.test_quiz_detail_view_loads`**

*   **Error:** `AssertionError: False is not true : Couldn't find 'Quiz 1' in response`
*   **Analysis:** Besides the static files issue possibly preventing parts of the template from rendering correctly, the test asserts that the *text* "Quiz 1" is present in the response body. Looking at `multi_choice_quiz/templates/multi_choice_quiz/index.html`, the quiz title (`{{ quiz.title }}`) is primarily used in the results panel (`#quiz-results-panel`), which isn't visible initially. The test might be expecting the title elsewhere in the main quiz view.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  Fix the static files issue first (run `collectstatic`). This might resolve it if JS was needed to render the part the test was looking for.
    2.  If it still fails, consider adding the quiz title visibly *outside* the results panel in `multi_choice_quiz/index.html`. For example, add `<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-center mb-4 text-accent-heading">{{ quiz.title }}</h1>` near the top, inside the `#quiz-app-container`.
    3.  Alternatively, make the test less strict, e.g., only check the `<title>` tag or context variables, but ensuring the title is visible to the user is generally better.

**Failure 2: `test_responsive_layout` (Login Page Variants)**

*   **Errors:**
    *   `Mobile menu toggle should be visible on /login/ at mobile` (mobile, sm)
    *   `Desktop nav should be visible on /login/ at md` (md, lg, xl, 2xl)
*   **Analysis:** These failures consistently happen *only* on the login page (`/accounts/login/`, rendered by `registration/login.html`). This template extends `pages/base.html`. The tests expect the standard header navigation (either mobile toggle or desktop links) to be present, but they aren't found. This implies that either the template extension is somehow broken *only* for this template, or there's a very specific CSS/JS conflict on the login page preventing the header nav from rendering correctly. The base template structure itself seems fine, as it works for other pages.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Verify Template Extension:** Double-check `src/templates/registration/login.html`. Ensure `{% extends 'pages/base.html' %}` is the very first line and there are no stray characters before it.
    2.  **Check Blocks:** Ensure `login.html` only defines blocks intended (like `{% block content %}`) and doesn't accidentally override the header block from `base.html`. (The current `login.html` looks correct in this regard).
    3.  **Simplify Locators (Test Side):** As a diagnostic step, modify `pages/tests/test_responsive.py`. Instead of the specific `header div.md\\:hidden > button` and `header nav.hidden.md\\:flex` locators, try simpler ones like `header button:visible` (for mobile) and `header nav:visible` (for desktop) *just for the login page check* to see if *any* button/nav renders in the header. This helps isolate if the issue is the element *type* or its specific *responsive classes*.
    4.  **Inspect Rendered HTML:** Manually load `/accounts/login/` in your browser, resize the window, and use developer tools to inspect the header. Is the expected HTML structure (with `md:hidden`, `md:flex` etc.) actually present in the DOM?

**Failure 3: `test_responsive_layout` (Signup Page Variants)**

*   **Error:** `AssertionError: Placeholder notice should be visible on /signup/ at mobile` (and similar for other sizes)
*   **Analysis:** The test `pages/tests/test_responsive.py` explicitly checks for a `div` with the text "Note:" at the bottom of the login and signup pages (`notice_locator = "div.fixed.bottom-0:has-text('Note:')"`). However, you implemented the actual signup form in Phase 2, and the placeholder notice was (correctly) removed from `pages/signup.html`. The test wasn't updated.
*   **Solution:** Modify `pages/tests/test_responsive.py`. In the `test_responsive_layout` function, find the section checking the notice (`if page_path in ["/login/", "/signup/", "/profile/"]:`). Update the logic so it *only* expects the notice on `/login/` (and potentially `/profile/`, depending on its current state - the profile notice text changed too). Remove the expectation for the `/signup/` page.

```python
# Inside pages/tests/test_responsive.py -> test_responsive_layout

    # Placeholder/Profile pages notice check
    if page_path in ["/login/", "/signup/", "/profile/"]:
        page.wait_for_timeout(200) # Small wait before checking notice
        notice_locator_old = "div.fixed.bottom-0:has-text('Note:')" # Old notice text
        notice_locator_profile = "div.fixed.bottom-0:has-text('Edit Profile, Stats')" # New profile notice text

        if page_path == "/login/":
             notice = page.locator(notice_locator_old)
             expect(
                 notice, f"Placeholder notice should be visible on {page_path} at {bp_name}"
             ).to_be_visible(timeout=5000)
        elif page_path == "/profile/":
             notice = page.locator(notice_locator_profile)
             expect(
                 notice, f"Placeholder notice should be visible on {page_path} at {bp_name}"
             ).to_be_visible(timeout=5000)
        # elif page_path == "/signup/":
             # No notice expected on the functional signup page, so do nothing here.
        #    pass
```

**Failure 4: `test_responsive_layout` (Profile Page Variants)**

*   **Error:** `playwright._impl._errors.TimeoutError: Locator.fill: Timeout 30000ms exceeded. - waiting for locator("#id_username")`
*   **Analysis:** This test tries to log in before accessing `/profile/`. It fails because it's trying to fill an input with `id="id_username"` on the login page. However, your `registration/login.html` uses `<input type="text" id="username" ...>`. The locator in the test is wrong.
*   **Solution:** Modify `pages/tests/test_responsive.py`. In the login block within `test_responsive_layout` (inside `if page_path == "/profile/":`), change the locators:
    *   Change `page.locator("#id_username").fill(test_user)` to `page.locator("#username").fill(test_user)`
    *   Change `page.locator("#id_password").fill(test_pass)` to `page.locator("#password").fill(test_pass)`

**Summary of Actions:**

1.  **Run `python manage.py collectstatic`**. This is the most critical step and likely fixes most E2E failures related to quiz interaction.
2.  **Modify `pages/tests/test_responsive.py`**:
    *   Update the login locators for the profile tests (`#username`, `#password`).
    *   Update the placeholder notice check to *not* expect the old notice on `/signup/` and expect the new notice text on `/profile/`.
    *   (Optional/Diagnostic) Temporarily simplify header locators for the `/login/` check if the primary fix doesn't work.
3.  **Modify `multi_choice_quiz/templates/multi_choice_quiz/index.html`**: Add `<h1>{{ quiz.title }}</h1>` (or similar) near the top to ensure the title is visible for `QuizViewTests.test_quiz_detail_view_loads`.
4.  **Re-run Tests:** Execute `pytest -v -s` again.

Address the `collectstatic` issue first, then the locator/test expectation issues. The login page header navigation failure might require closer inspection if the other fixes don't resolve it.
