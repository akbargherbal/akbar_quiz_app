Okay, I understand your goal: you want to transform your entire PostgreSQL database (from the `.sql.gz` backup) into a collection of Pandas DataFrames, and then save each of those DataFrames as a separate `.pkl` (pickle) file. This would give you a snapshot of your database in a format that Pandas can readily load and work with, without needing a live database connection for subsequent analysis of *that specific snapshot*.

Here's the most practical and reliable way to achieve this:

**The "Restore, Extract, Pickle" Workflow**

This involves restoring the database to a temporary local PostgreSQL instance, then using Python with Pandas and SQLAlchemy to extract each table into a DataFrame and save it as a pickle file.

**Prerequisites:**

1.  **PostgreSQL Installed Locally:** (As described in Option 1 of the previous answer).
2.  **Your `.sql.gz` Backup File:** e.g., `quiz_export_20240516.sql.gz`.
3.  **Python Environment with Libraries:**
    *   `pandas`
    *   `SQLAlchemy`
    *   `psycopg2-binary`
    *   `python-dotenv` (optional, for managing local DB credentials if you prefer)

    Install them:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary python-dotenv
    ```
4.  **Output Directory:** Create a directory where you want to save the `.pkl` files (e.g., `database_pkl_export/`).

**Steps:**

**Step 1: Restore the Database to a Local PostgreSQL Instance**

*   **Install PostgreSQL Locally:** If you haven't already.
*   **Create a Temporary Local Database:**
    ```bash
    # Using psql
    CREATE DATABASE temp_db_for_pickle_export;
    ```
*   **Decompress and Restore your Backup:**
    ```bash
    gunzip quiz_export_20240516.sql.gz
    psql -U your_local_postgres_user -d temp_db_for_pickle_export -f quiz_export_20240516.sql
    ```
    (Replace `your_local_postgres_user` with your actual local PostgreSQL superuser or a user with rights to `temp_db_for_pickle_export`). You'll be prompted for the password.

**Step 2: Write a Python Script to Extract Tables to Pickle Files**

Create a Python script (e.g., `db_to_pkl.py`):

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text
from dotenv import load_dotenv # Optional: if you use a .env file for local DB credentials

# --- Configuration ---
# Optional: Load local DB credentials from a .env file
# load_dotenv()
# LOCAL_DB_USER = os.getenv("LOCAL_DB_USER", "postgres") # Default to 'postgres' or your local user
# LOCAL_DB_PASSWORD = os.getenv("LOCAL_DB_PASSWORD", "your_password") # Your local DB password
# LOCAL_DB_NAME = "temp_db_for_pickle_export"
# LOCAL_DB_HOST = "localhost"
# LOCAL_DB_PORT = "5432"

# Direct Configuration (if not using .env)
LOCAL_DB_USER = "your_local_postgres_user"  # Replace with your local PostgreSQL username
LOCAL_DB_PASSWORD = "your_local_postgres_password"  # Replace with your password
LOCAL_DB_NAME = "temp_db_for_pickle_export"
LOCAL_DB_HOST = "localhost"
LOCAL_DB_PORT = "5432"

OUTPUT_DIR = "database_pkl_export"  # Directory to save .pkl files

# Ensure output directory exists
os.makedirs(OUTPUT_DIR, exist_ok=True)

# Construct the database URL for SQLAlchemy
DATABASE_URL = f"postgresql+psycopg2://{LOCAL_DB_USER}:{LOCAL_DB_PASSWORD}@{LOCAL_DB_HOST}:{LOCAL_DB_PORT}/{LOCAL_DB_NAME}"

try:
    engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
    print(f"Successfully connected to local database: {LOCAL_DB_NAME}")

    with engine.connect() as connection:
        # Get a list of all user tables in the public schema (common for Django apps)
        # (Excludes system tables from pg_catalog and information_schema)
        query_tables = text("""
            SELECT tablename
            FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables
            WHERE schemaname = 'public';
        """)
        # If your tables are in a different schema, adjust 'public' accordingly.

        tables_result = connection.execute(query_tables)
        table_names = [row[0] for row in tables_result]

        if not table_names:
            print("No tables found in the 'public' schema. Check schema name or database content.")
        else:
            print(f"\nFound tables: {table_names}")

            for table_name in table_names:
                print(f"Processing table: {table_name}...")
                try:
                    # Read the entire table into a Pandas DataFrame
                    df = pd.read_sql_table(table_name, connection, schema='public') # Specify schema if needed

                    # Define the output pickle file path
                    pkl_file_path = os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, f"{table_name}.pkl")

                    # Save the DataFrame to a pickle file
                    df.to_pickle(pkl_file_path)
                    print(f"  Saved {table_name} to {pkl_file_path}")

                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"  Error processing table {table_name}: {e}")

    print("\nDatabase export to .pkl files complete.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred during the database connection or export process: {e}")
finally:
    if 'engine' in locals() and engine:
        engine.dispose()
        print("Database connection closed.")

```

**Before running the script:**

*   Replace `"your_local_postgres_user"` and `"your_local_postgres_password"` with your actual local PostgreSQL credentials.
*   Make sure the `OUTPUT_DIR` exists or the script will create it.

**Step 3: Run the Python Script**

```bash
python db_to_pkl.py
```

This script will:
1.  Connect to your local `temp_db_for_pickle_export` database.
2.  Query the `pg_catalog.pg_tables` to get a list of all user-defined tables (typically in the `public` schema for Django apps).
3.  For each table found:
    *   Read the entire table into a Pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_sql_table()`.
    *   Save that DataFrame to a `.pkl` file named `tablename.pkl` inside your `OUTPUT_DIR`.

**What You Get:**

After the script finishes, your `database_pkl_export/` directory will contain a set of `.pkl` files, one for each table in your database. For example:

```
database_pkl_export/
├── auth_group.pkl
├── auth_group_permissions.pkl
├── auth_permission.pkl
├── auth_user.pkl
├── auth_user_groups.pkl
├── auth_user_user_permissions.pkl
├── django_admin_log.pkl
├── django_content_type.pkl
├── django_migrations.pkl
├── django_session.pkl
├── multi_choice_quiz_chapter.pkl
├── multi_choice_quiz_question.pkl
├── multi_choice_quiz_choice.pkl
├── multi_choice_quiz_quizattempt.pkl
├── multi_choice_quiz_useranswer.pkl
# ... and any other tables your app uses (e.g., from 'pages', 'pwa' apps)
```

**How to Use the `.pkl` Files Later:**

You can easily load any of these tables back into a Pandas DataFrame in another Python script or Jupyter Notebook:

```python
import pandas as pd
import os

PICKLE_DIR = "database_pkl_export"

# Load a specific table
df_questions = pd.read_pickle(os.path.join(PICKLE_DIR, "multi_choice_quiz_question.pkl"))
df_users = pd.read_pickle(os.path.join(PICKLE_DIR, "auth_user.pkl"))

print("Questions DataFrame head:")
print(df_questions.head())

print("\nUsers DataFrame head:")
print(df_users.head())

# Now you can work with these DataFrames directly
# For example, to simulate a JOIN (you'd do this manually with Pandas merge/join):
# df_merged = pd.merge(df_questions, df_users, left_on='author_id', right_on='id', how='left') # Example
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Data Types:** Pandas `to_pickle` and `read_pickle` generally do a good job of preserving data types. However, complex or custom PostgreSQL types might require special handling or might not be perfectly round-tripped. Standard types (integers, floats, strings, booleans, datetimes) usually work fine.
*   **File Size:** Pickle files can be quite large, especially for tables with many rows or large text/binary data. They are often not as compressed as the original `.sql.gz` dump.
*   **Relationships:** When you load these `.pkl` files, you get individual DataFrames. The foreign key relationships that existed in the database are just columns with IDs in these DataFrames. You'll need to use Pandas' `merge` or `join` functions to combine data from different tables, mimicking SQL JOINs.
*   **Not a Live Database:** This is a *snapshot*. Changes made to the live database after this export will not be reflected in these `.pkl` files.
*   **Security of `.pkl` Files:** Pickle files can potentially execute arbitrary code if loaded from an untrusted source. Since you are generating these files yourself from your own database, it's safe for your own use. Be cautious if you were to receive `.pkl` files from others.
*   **Large Databases:** If your database is extremely large (many gigabytes or terabytes), reading entire tables into memory at once might be an issue. For such scenarios, you might need to process tables in chunks or consider alternative formats like Parquet (which is more efficient for large-scale analytical workloads). However, for most typical application databases, this approach is feasible.
*   **Cleaning Up:** Once you have your `.pkl` files, you can drop the `temp_db_for_pickle_export` local database if you no longer need it:
    ```bash
    # Using psql
    DROP DATABASE temp_db_for_pickle_export;
    ```

This "Restore, Extract, Pickle" workflow directly addresses your desire to get your entire database into a collection of Pandas pickle files for offline analysis and archival.
